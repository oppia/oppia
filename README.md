Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing and get feedback.

Oppia is written using Python and AngularJS, and is built on top of Google App Engine.
