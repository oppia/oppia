    Exploration Design Tips
  </h2>

  <p>
    One of Oppia's strengths is its ability to bring interactivity and

       rel="nofollow">
      guided discovery learning
    </a>
    to online, computer-based learning. Thus, a common format for an Oppia exploration is to pose a problem to the reader, and guide them towards
    solving this problem by posing a series of questions. This way, the reader
    actively discovers the answer with the exploration's help, as opposed to
    just being told what the answer is.

    General tips
  </h2>

  <p>
    Once you have a clear idea of what concept your exploration is trying to
    teach, it's usually easiest to start by coming up with a single series of
    questions and answers that might help a student understand this concept.
    These will form the "critical path" of your exploration -- the trunk on
    which all the other branches will depend. It doesn't really matter what
    this path is, as long as it goes all the way from start to finish.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you outline this path, you will also want to think about how you'd like
    to present it. For example, a story format with the reader cast in the main
    role is very suitable for a discovery-style exploration: stories can help
    maintain interest in the subject of the exploration by drawing parallels
    between exploring a fictional world and investigating the concept you want
    to teach; and between resolving the plot of the story and solving the core
    problem in the exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if you choose not to have an explicit story with characters, you
    should still think about characterization: if the exploration is a series
    of leading questions (with hints, examples, etc.), who is asking these
    questions, and why? Are they an authority figure who already knows
    everything, or a fellow learner who comes up with ideas when the real
    student can't quite make the leap? The latter is more consistent with the
    idea of "discovery learning", and students are likely to be more receptive
    to it.

    </a>
    Exploration design patterns
  </h2>

  <p>
    Once you've implemented a basic version of the exploration in Oppia, you
    can add different branches to it as necessary. There are several common
    design patterns you can use for this:
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Common_misconceptions" class="anchor" href="#Common_misconceptions"
       aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Common misconceptions
  </h3>

  <p>
    If you know or anticipate that students will get a question wrong in a
    particular way (like, say, forgetting to multiply an answer by 2 in a math
    problem), you can catch that with an appropriate answer classifier and
    redirect those students to a longer, more elaborate explanation of the
    topic. After that, this longer path would then typically rejoin the
    critical path.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Shortcuts" class="anchor" href="#Shortcuts" aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Shortcuts
  </h3>

  <p>
    Conversely, if your critical path assumes that a topic typically needs a
    pretty detailed explanation, you might consider putting in a shortcut
    answer that would allow a student who has already understood the topic to
    skip the long path. This works especially well with text or other
    open-ended input - in such cases, there is often the "mostly-correct"
    answer that sends the student on the typical path, and the "really nailed
    it" answer that shows that the student already has a handle on the concept
    and can jump ahead.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Loopbacks" class="anchor" href="#Loopbacks" aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Loopbacks
  </h3>

  <p>
    Another way to deal with wrong answers is to simply loop back and ask the
    question again. But for this to be beneficial and educational, you must
    tell the student what was wrong with their answer. Therefore, when using
    loopbacks like this, you should classify the possible wrong answers in as
    much detail as possible, and provide detailed feedback on why a particular
    answer was wrong. (It might also be a good idea to mix and match: loop the
    student back to the question for simple mistakes, but take them on a longer
    path that addresses their misconception in detail if they make a more
    fundamental error.)
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some considerations and issues to watch out for when using
    loopbacks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Do</strong> provide specific feedback about why the answer was
      wrong (or why the student is being redirected back to this card). This
      feedback should be constructive enough to help the student find the
      correct answer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do</strong> consider restating or rephrasing the original
      question in the feedback. This way you are reminding the student what the
      question was, they may get a better insight with a different phrasing of
      the same question, and you avoid creating ambiguity with a different
      question.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Don't</strong> ask a different question in your feedback: It is
      often surprisingly tempting to phrase your feedback in the form of a
      question: "What if we tried it this way?" or "What about this number?"
      But this becomes really confusing for the reader because they are now
      trying to answer this new question, whereas the exploration is expecting
      an answer to the original question.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Don't</strong> use loopbacks for incorrect text-field answers (or
      other free-form classifiers). Avoid situations where there's just one
      "correct" answer that moves you along, but lots of wrong answers that
      make you loop back and guess again. Having to read the exploration
      creator's mind can be very frustrating.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A good rule of thumb for whether you should use loopbacks is whether you
    can separate all the possible "wrong" answers into large groups, for which
    you can provide explicit helpful feedback that gives the reader more
    information. If not, you may be better off branching into a longer
    explanatory branch on a wrong answer. Getting the correct answer on the
    first guess would then become a "shortcut", rather than form an obstacle
    that gates the reader's progress.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Coming_back_to_earlier_cards" class="anchor" href="#Coming_back_to_earlier_cards" aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Coming back to earlier cards
  </h3>

  <p>
    It's fine for an exploration to contain cycles. Certain paths that a
    student takes may bring him back to an earlier card in the exploration,
    even after he's progressed past it once. The primary reason for this is
    review: if the student seems completely confused about an earlier topic,
    the best thing to do may be to go through that topic again.
  </p>
  <p>
    One bad pattern to avoid here is making the student repeat and review many
    topics because they forgot or messed up one of them. If you bring a student
    back to an earlier card, make sure there's also an easy way for them to get
    back to where they were, once the review is done (perhaps by taking
    shortcuts that you've put in for students who already know the answers).
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Giving_the_student_an_explicit_choice" class="anchor"

      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Giving the student an explicit choice
  </h3>
  <p>
    You don't always have to guess what's best for the student, or what the
    student would like to do next. Sometimes you can just ask them! Choice will
    give them a sense of agency, and might make them a bit more involved in
    what they're doing, since they chose it! For example, you can ask them
    things like: which sub-topics they would like to cover (or which ones they
    would like to cover first), how much detail they'd like to go into in the
    next explanation (short path or long?), how they'd like you to explain
    something (pictures? text? a game?), or whether they'd like to practice a
    skill you just taught.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Implicit_choice_through_a_free-form_answer" class="anchor"
       href="#Implicit_choice_through_a_free-form_answer" aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Implicit choice through a free-form answer
  </h3>
  <p>
    You can also make the choice implicit. Ask a somewhat open-ended question,
    and branch based on that answer. One very general way to do this is to just
    ask "Do you have any ideas on how to solve that problem?" and if they
    mention a specific sub-topic, you can branch on that and address that
    sub-topic first. This is very effective in making the student feel engaged
    and like he's actively participating in a discussion: it feels great when
    you type in an answer and Oppia actually responds to exactly what you said!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Students can sometimes get confused and lost if the question is too broad
      or open-ended, because they are unsure of what exactly is expected of
      them. They may just say "I don't know". In that case, the exploration can
      simply go on with a detailed guided walkthrough of the topics involved.
      If you use a broad question like this, try to make it clear that there's
      no one right (or wrong) answer; you're just looking for ideas. Or, if you
      have a specific type of answer in mind, be as explicit as possible about
      what you're looking for - without giving away the answer, of course!
      Ultimately, it's up to you as the exploration creator to moderate the
      broadness of the question.
    </li>
    <li>
      These open-ended questions are also a good time to catch possible
      misconceptions. In addition to branching on interesting sub-topics the
      reader might mention, you can also branch on responses that indicate some
      kind of confusion or misunderstanding.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you are classifying a free-form answer, you don't have to commit to
      saying whether the answer was "right" or "wrong". Even if your
      classifiers didn't catch any of the keywords you were looking for, the
      exploration (or the characters) can simply explain your own point of view
      on the question and then go from there. This feels more conversational,
      and won't frustrate students who did have the right idea, but didn't use
      the words you expected.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the student's answer does trigger a keyword-based classifier, try
      repeating the triggering words in the feedback that you give for that
      answer (in a complete sentence, of course). This creates an explicit echo
      to what the student has just said. It also gives you a chance to form a
      complete, clear thought around whatever concept triggered the
      classifier - maybe the student had only a vague idea of what they were
      talking about, but now it is as if both of you discovered and clarified
      the idea together.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Practice exercises and testing
  </h3>
  <p>
    Interaction and hands-on experiences can help students better understand
    and retain the material. And testing of course is important for making sure
    that the student understood things correctly. Tests, exercises, and
    hands-on activities can either use custom interactions that you (or someone
    else!) has built, or simply use Oppia's classifiers. You can also branch
    based on the results of an exercise: did the student do what you expected?
    are there certain weak areas that the exercise revealed, that need to be
    addressed more?
  </p>
  <p>
    In a way, of course, all of an Oppia exploration is an interactive
    exercise! But it can be helpful to think of the exploration as separated
    into "learning" sections and more concentrated "exercise" sections that
    focus more on repetition and testing of what the student has already
    learned.

    Optional side-topics
  </h3>
  <p>
    Some readers may be interested in learning about or exploring additional
    topics. You can add side diversions that take take them on a completely
    optional branch (if they select that option), and then bring them back to
    the main exploration once that branch is over.

    Counterexamples
  </h3>
  <p>
    Counterexamples are a great way to provide feedback for a wrong answer.
    They are very much in line with the idea of discovery learning - exploring
    potential answers and seeing patterns in why they are wrong helps the
    student form a correct model of the problem herself, without relying on
    passive explanations.

    Parameter-based design patterns
  </h2>
  <p>
    Oppia's parameter functionality enables a number of interesting design
    patterns. <a href="#Parameters">Here</a> is a more detailed guide to using
    parameters, with examples.

      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Randomized questions
  </h3>
  <p>
    It's easy to create a randomized parameter that takes one of several
    specified values at random. You can then use this parameter in a question,
    so that the question is slightly different every time the student sees it.
  </p>

  <h3>
    <a id="Making_content_dynamic" class="anchor" href="#Making_content_dynamic"
       aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Making content dynamic
  </h3>
  <p>
    Often, when a student returns to a card they already visited, the original
    phrasing of the question or statement doesn't make much sense anymore. If
    you use a parameter to keep track of whether the card's been visited before,
    you can rephrase the text of the card slightly the second time around using
    an expression that's something like:

    <tt>
      <code>
        {{if redux == 1 then "'So, how do you think he does it?' asks your friend." else "Ah, so where were we again?"}}
      </code>
    </tt>

    In this case, if the parameter "redux" is set to 1, the second phrase is
    used; if it is not, then the first phrase is used. (You will also need to
    have a parameter change in that card, setting the parameter appropriately.)
    You can extend this technique to keep track of the number of times the
    card's been visited, and display slightly different things depending on
    that number.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same technique can also work to give slightly different feedback
    depending on how the student got to the current card, for example:
    <tt>
      <code>
        {{if train_taken == 1 then "Did you take the train here?" else "How did you get here?! I didn't see you on the train"}}
      </code>
    </tt>
  </p>

       aria-hidden="true">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Parameterized feedback
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes it's useful to use parameters in the feedback you give to the
    students, especially if the question and answer used those same parameters
    in some way. This works especially well with math-related explorations and
    numeric answers, because you can easily perform arithmetic on numerical
    parameters, and tailor your feedback to apply precisely to the student's
    answer. You can use expressions like <code>{{answer+1}}</code> or
    <code>{{value1/value2}}</code> to manipulate and process parameters before
    displaying them in the feedback (or anywhere else).

    </a>
    Echoing back the answer
  </h3>
  <p>
    Even if your exploration is not mathematical, it can be useful to echo back
    the student's answer either immediately ("Oh, so you think that
    <code>{{answer}}</code>?") or later on ("I think you said that your
    favorite color was <code>{{color}}</code>?"). For the latter case, you'd
    have to remember that answer using a dedicated parameter ("color" in the
    example).
