    Card Editor: Non-interactive content
  </h2>

  <p>
    Non-interactive content is content that is shown to the reader, but that
    does not invite the reader to respond in a way that Oppia can provide
    feedback to. For example, a YouTube video is one possible type of
    non-interactive content. However, although the reader can fast-forward the
    video, skip to the end, or press the play/pause buttons, none of this input
    is regarded as a communication from the reader to Oppia. Thus, no card
    transitions are possible here, and the content provided here will simply be
    displayed to the reader.

  <p>
    Currently, non-interactive content can be entered via the rich-text editor:

  <p>
    The rich-text editor has a section for custom extensions such as images and
    YouTube videos. To add them, click on the corresponding icon in the editor
    toolbar.
