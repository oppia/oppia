    Downloading Explorations
  </h2>

  <p>
    You can export your explorations to zip files and share them with other
    people. To download your exploration, navigate to the History tab and click
    the download link next to the version of the exploration you want to
    download.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will download a zip file containing the data for your exploration. It
    will contain a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" rel="nofollow">YAML</a>
    file, as well as any additional asset files (such as images) that are
    included with your exploration.

    Uploading Explorations
  </h2>

  <p>
    Currently, YAML file uploading is turned off for the
    <a href="https://oppia.org" rel="nofollow">oppia.org site</a>. However, you
    can upload files to your local or hosted copies of Oppia. To do this, log
    in as an admin to the instance, and go to the Admin Page. Under
    'Configuration', select the option to allow file uploads via YAML in the
    gallery page, and then click the "Save" button at the bottom of the
    'Configuration' section.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should now be able to upload YAML files when creating a new exploration
    from the gallery page.
