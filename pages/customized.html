    The Card Editor
  </h2>

  <p>
    On the exploration editor page, you will see a graph of interlinked cards.
    Clicking on any of these cards takes you to the card editor page, which
    will look something like this:
  </p>

  <p><img src="static/images/stateEditor.png" width="100%"></p>

  <p>This page consists of four parts: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#NoninteractiveContent">Non-interactive content</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Interactions">Interactions</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Rules">Rules</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Parameters">Parameter changes</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The page may also contain statistics about the card. For example, in the
    screenshot above, we can see a to-do list containing the responses that hit
    the 'default rule'. If a particular answer appears in this list multiple
    times, it suggests that writing a separate, more targeted rule for it might
    be a good idea. You can remove the response from the list at any time by
    clicking the corresponding 'Delete' text on the right-hand side.
