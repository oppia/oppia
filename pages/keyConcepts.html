    Key Concepts in Oppia
  </h2>

  <p>
    An Oppia exploration is meant to simulate a one-on-one conversation between
    a tutor and a student. Here's an example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: Let's say you had a red ball, a blue ball and a
      yellow ball. How many different color arrangements can you get if you put
      them in a straight line?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Student</strong>: (thinks) There are four ways.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutor</strong>: OK, what are they?</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Student</strong>: Well, you can put the red ball on the left, the
      blue ball in the middle, and the yellow ball on the right -- so,
      Red-Blue-Yellow. There's also Blue-Red-Yellow, Blue-Yellow-Red, and
      Red-Blue-Yellow. That's four ways.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tutor</strong>: I think you've counted one of them twice...</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Student</strong>: Oops, oh yes. There's an extra Red-Blue-Yellow.
      So, there's three ways.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: Well, let's check that we haven't missed any.
      Let's say the red ball is on the left. Have you found all the
      possibilities in that case?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Student</strong>: Well, there's Red-Blue-Yellow -- oh, and
      Red-Yellow-Blue. Oh, and also Yellow-Blue-Red. And Yellow-Red-Blue.
      (Pause.) I think that's all.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tutor</strong>: OK, are you sure we haven't missed any?</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Student</strong>: Well, I found all the ways with the Red ball on
      the left -- and all the ways with the Blue ball on the left, and all the
      ways with the Yellow ball on the left. So I think that's all.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: Yes, that's great. It's important to work
      systematically and do this sort of thing in an orderly way, otherwise
      you'll probably miss something. By the way, it looks like there are two
      arrangements for each of the three cases you mention; I wonder why that
      is...? (1)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Notice that this conversation involves the student a lot, and that the
    tutor is trying to understand the student's answers and provide appropriate
    feedback that will help the student to get a better understanding of what's
    going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Oppia, such a conversation is modelled as a series of <strong>cards</strong>.
    Each card is made up of a 'tutor' part (the <strong>content</strong>) and a
    'student' part (the <strong>interaction</strong>). For example, here is a
    screenshot of the learner view of an exploration that models the first part
    of the above conversation:
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/three_balls.png" width="100%;">

  <p>
    The tutor presents a question with a picture (the 'content'), and offers,
    as the 'interaction', an input field that allows the student to type in a
    number.
  </p>

  <p>Based on the student's response, the tutor may decide to do different things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the answer is 6, they may immediately move to a harder follow-up
      question, such as the case of four balls.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the answer is less than 6, they may ask the student to enumerate the
      cases, in the hope that the error will become clearer.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the answer is obviously too small or obviously too large, they may
      point that out, in order to help the student learn how to do 'sanity
      checks'.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    and so on. These choices are called <strong>rules</strong>. As responses
    from students come in, the rules can be edited, and new rules added --
    there's no need to determine all the possible rules at the outset. Note
    that all this complexity is effectively hidden from the learner, since each
    learner playthrough resembles a linear conversation. The following
    screenshot shows what two different playthroughs of the same exploration
    look like, when placed side-by-side:
  </p>

  <p>To summarize:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The learning units in Oppia are called <strong>explorations</strong>.</li>
    <li>Each exploration is divided up into <strong>cards</strong>.</li>
    <li>
      Each card consists of some (non-interactive) <strong>content</strong> and
      an <strong>interaction</strong> which accepts a student's response.
    </li>
    <li>
      Based on the response, Oppia determines what to say next based on a set
      of <strong>rules</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that Oppia also comes packaged with additional features (such as
    parameters) that allow further personalization of an exploration. Read on

    (1) Note the difference between this conversation and the following two
    conversations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: Let's say you had a red ball, a blue ball and a
      yellow ball. How many different color arrangements can you get if you put
      them in a straight line?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Student</strong>: (thinks) There are four ways.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutor</strong>: Wrong. Try again.</li>
    <li><strong>Student</strong>: (thinks) There are five ways.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutor</strong>: Wrong. Try again.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>and</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: Let's say you had a red ball, a blue ball and a
      yellow ball. How many different color arrangements can you get if you put
      them in a straight line?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Student</strong>: (thinks) There are four ways.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tutor</strong>: No, there are six ways. This is because there are
      three ways to pick the ball in the first position. For each of these
      three ways there are two ways to pick the ball in the second position.
      After that, the final ball is fixed. So there are 3 x 2 x 1 ways, which
      is 6 ways. Do you understand?
    </li>
    <li><strong>Student</strong>: ... </li>
  </ul>
