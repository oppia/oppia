    Card Editor: Interactions
  </h2>

  <p>
    Every card in Oppia contains an interaction that allows a learner to
    communicate with Oppia. Examples of such interactions are text input fields,
    multiple-choice inputs, an embeddable and clickable Google Map, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simplest interaction is the 'Continue' button. The only thing that the
    learner can do with this interaction is to click on it. This will show
    the learner another card, as specified by the exploration creator.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, most interactions permit the learner to be more expressive. The
    general pattern is as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A learner sends a response to Oppia by submitting an answer to the
      interaction. This communication may be triggered by clicking a button,
      typing a character, hitting a key, and so on. The trigger is defined by
      the developer of the interaction.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Oppia matches the learner's response against a set of
      <a href="#Rules">rules</a>. It takes the feedback attached to the first
      rule that applies to the learner's input, and displays it to the learner.
      It also changes the learner's card based on the instructions attached to
      that rule. If no rule applies to the learner's input, the default rule is
      used.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Specifying an interaction
  </h2>

  <p>
    To specify an interaction, click "Change type" in the right column under the
    'Interaction' heading.
  </p>

  <p><img src="static/images/interactiveWidget.png" width="300"></p>

  <p>
    This will open up a dialog box from which you can select a new interaction
    from the ones that are available.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> At the moment, changing the interaction type will
    delete all existing rules and feedback (except the default rule).

    Customizing an interaction
  </h2>
  <p>
    Some interactions are customizable. For example, the Text interaction allows
    customization of the default placeholder text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that these customization options are distinct from
    <a href="#Parameters">exploration parameters</a>, which are attached to the
    learner's session and remain with the learner throughout the exploration.
    The values of these options are only used in the display of the interaction,
    and are not persisted between cards.

    Writing custom interactions
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you would like to use an interaction that does not already exist, you can
    <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Creating-Interactions">write your own</a>,
    but in order to do this you will need to know how to write HTML and
    JavaScript code. If you believe that the interaction you write is likely to
    be useful more generally, please consider <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing</a> it to Oppia so that others can make use of it.
  </p>

    like, and what you would like it to do. This allows us to keep track of the
    request, and someone might be able to help you -- but there are no
    guarantees. Having said that, if your interaction is likely to be generally
    useful to other creators, the chances of it getting built are higher.
