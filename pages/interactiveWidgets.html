  <p>Every card in Oppia contains an interaction that allows a reader to communicate with Oppia. Examples of such interactions are text input fields, multiple-choice inputs, an embeddable and clickable Google Map, and so on. </p>
  <p>The simplest interaction is the 'Continue' button. The only thing that the reader can do with this interaction is to click on it. This will transition the reader to another card, as specified by the exploration creator. </p>
  <p>However, most interactions permit the reader to be more expressive than this. The general pattern is as follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A reader sends a response to Oppia by submitting an answer to the interaction. This communication may be triggered by clicking a button, typing a character, hitting a key, and so on. The trigger is defined by the developer of the interaction. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Oppia matches the reader's response against a set of <a href="#Rules">rules</a>. It takes the feedback attached to the first rule that applies to the reader's input, and displays it to the reader. It also changes the reader's card based on the instructions attached to that rule. If no rule applies to the reader's input, the default rule is used. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can find out more about rules on <a href="#Rules">this page</a>. </p>

    <a id="Specifying_an_interaction" class="anchor" href="#Specifying_an_interaction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specifying an interaction</h2>
  <p>To specify an interaction, click "Change type" in the right column under the 'Interaction' heading. </p>
  <p><img src="http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/interactiveWidget.png" width="300"> </p>
  <p>This will open up a dialog box from which you can select a new interaction from the ones that are available. </p>
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> At the moment, changing the interaction type will delete all existing rules and feedback (except the default rule). </p>

    <a id="Customizing_an_interaction" class="anchor" href="#Customizing_an_interaction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customizing an interaction</h2>
  <p>Some interactions are customizable. For example, the Text interaction allows customization of the default placeholder text. </p>
  <p>Note that these customization options are distinct from <a href="">exploration parameters(TODO:Add link)</a>, which are attached to the reader's session and remain with the reader throughout the exploration. The values of these options are only used in the display of the interaction, and are not persisted between cards. </p>

    <a id="Writing_custom_interactions" class="anchor" href="#Writing_custom_interactions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing custom interactions</h2>
  <p>If you would like to use an interaction that does not already exist, you can write your own, but in order to do this you will need to know how to write HTML and JavaScript code. More instructions can be found <a href="">here(TODO:Add link)</a>. If you believe that the interaction you write is likely to be useful more generally, please consider <a href="">contributing(TODO:Add link)</a> it to our source tree so that others can make use of it. </p>
  <p>Alternatively, you could file an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new" rel="nofollow">issue tracker</a>, describing what type of interaction you would like, and what you would like it to do. The advantage of this is that someone might be able to help you create such a interaction; the disadvantage is that it is not guaranteed that this will happen in a timely fashion (or at all). However, if your interactions is likely to be generally useful to other users as well, the chances of it getting built are probably higher. </p>
