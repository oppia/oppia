    Improve the exploration
  </h2>
  <p>
    Oppia explorations are meant to be incrementally improved over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to improve an exploration, one starting point is to take a look
    at the answers that readers submitted. To view these, click on the
    "Exploration Stats" tab in the exploration editor. If any reader has viewed
    your exploration, you should see a page like this one:
  </p>
  <p><img src="static/images/analytics.png" width="100%"></p>
  <p>
    This shows the number of times your exploration has been completed, and
    gives a breakdown of how often each card was reached, how often each rule
    for a given card was hit, and the different answers that were given by
    learners.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use this information to make your exploration better. For example,
    you could identify a card in which a particular answer was submitted many
    times, which might suggest that a new rule should be created for this
    answer. Or you might see that a question is getting very few correct
    answers, which might suggest that it is unclear.
  </p>
  <p>
    To edit a particular card, you can click the card name in the left-hand
    column of the table to jump directly to that card's editor.
