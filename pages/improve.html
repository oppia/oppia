  <p>One of the main features of Oppia explorations is that they can be incrementally improved over time, and we are hoping to make this feature even better as time progresses. </p>
  <p>If you want to improve an exploration, one starting point is to take a look at the answers that readers submitted. To view these, click on the "Exploration Stats" tab in the exploration editor. If any reader has viewed your exploration, you should see a page like this one: </p>
  <p><img src="static/images/analytics.png" width="100%"> </p>
  <p>This shows the number of times your exploration has been completed, and gives a breakdown of how often each card was reached, how often each rule for a given card was hit, and the different answers that were given by readers. </p>
  <p>You can use this information to make your exploration better. For example, you could identify a card in which a particular answer was submitted many times, which might suggest that a new rule should be created for this answer. Or you might see that a question is getting very few correct answers, which might suggest that it is unclear. </p>
  <p>To edit a particular card, you can click the card name in the left-hand column of the table to jump directly to that card's editor. </p>
