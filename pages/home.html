    Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and
    share interactive activities. These activities, called 'explorations',
    simulate a one-on-one conversation with an intelligent tutor. You can try a
    hosted version at <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a>.

    Explorations are easy to create and quick to play. They can be published in
    the exploration gallery, shared on social media, or embedded on your
    webpage.

    Oppia supports 'learning by doing'. Your exploration can include embedded
    code editors, dynamic world maps, and many other options for interaction.

    Feedback is an essential part of learning. The branching nature of Oppia
    allows you to respond to mistakes and address misconceptions as learners
    progress through an exploration.

    Oppia runs on <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open source</strong>
    software. It is released under the Apache License 2.0.

    Requirements
  </h2>

  <p>
    If you plan to download the code and run your own instance of Oppia, you
    need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine, together with certain
    other dependencies specified on our Getting Started page. If you just want
    to create an exploration, you can do so on the hosted community site
    <a href="https://www.oppia.org">Oppia.org</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can download the developers' version of Oppia using git by following
    the instructions on our Getting Started page. Alternatively, you can
    download the latest stable release as a
    <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/archive/master.zip">zip file</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that Oppia also depends on various additional libraries, such as
    JQuery, Angular UI and Google App Engine. These libraries will be
    <em>downloaded automatically for you</em> when you run
    <code>scripts/start.sh</code>.
