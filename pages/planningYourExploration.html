    Planning Your Exploration
  </h2>
  <p>
    Oppia models a teacher-student interaction (or, more generally, the
    interaction between an exploration creator and a learner) by breaking it
    down into <i>cards</i>. The learner's answer represents a transition between
    cards, and the card itself contains Oppia's feedback.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the initial card of an exploration could consist of the question:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>"Can you figure out the value of 2 + 2?"</i>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "4", we might transition to the completed card,
      which says "Correct!".
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "-4", we might transition to the NegativeAnswer
      card, which says "You're adding two positive numbers together. Surely the
      answer should be positive?"
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the learner answers "Yes", we might transition to the SmartyPants card,
      which says "OK, what is 2 + 2?" (Or, better still, we would
      <a href="#Improve">rewrite the question to be clearer</a>, but that's
      another story.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that these subsequent cards also say something, and expect an answer
    from the learner. This is similar to a teacher asking a question of a
    student, and waiting for the answer.

    Planning Your Exploration
  </h2>
  <p>
    Writing an Oppia exploration is a bit more involved than writing a webpage
    or recording a video. This is not unexpected: the former media are somewhat
    static, whereas one of Oppia's highlights is that it is able to respond
    dynamically to learner input -- and thus it needs to handle different
    answers for each 'card'.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with writing one card that links to five cards, each of which
    links to five more cards, etc. is that it results in quite a bit of
    complexity. We recommend that you do not start by doing this. Instead,
    start by creating something that is, for the most part, linear. You can
    always add branching and loops later on. This will help you get to a
    'complete' exploration as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another suggestion is to spend some time planning your exploration on paper
    before converting it into a playable Oppia exploration, since it's easier
    to edit a rough pencil-and-paper draft in a way that still makes it easy to
    see the big picture.
  </p>
  <p>
    We'd also encourage you to have a look at the
    <a href="#DesignTips">Design Tips</a> page, which contains a large list of
    common patterns that you can make use of when writing an exploration.

    Crafting Individual Responses
  </h2>
  <p>
    Writing an exploration is not as complicated as it may seem. Basically, you
    would be answering the following question many times:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
      If the person I'm talking to says X in response to my question Y, what
      should I say?
    </i>
  </blockquote>
  <p>for different possibilities of X and Y.</p>

  <p>
    In other words, consider yourself to be in the position of someone who is
    having a 1-on-1 conversation with the learner. If the learner gives you a
    particular answer, how would you respond in a way that is most helpful for
    them? That is exactly what you should write for the feedback in that card.
