    The Learner View of an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    The Oppia learner view is meant to simulate a chat conversation, with the
    difference being that the learner can respond in a lot of different ways:
    they can write a proof, enter a number, click on a map, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following screenshot shows the start of the "Pitch Perfect" demo
    exploration, where Oppia gives an introduction, and then offers the learner
    a music staff on which they can drag and drop notes to match the desired
    sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the learner's response, Oppia will give them hints or ask further
    questions, as appropriate.

    Giving feedback
  </h3>

  <p>
    The learner can give feedback on any card of the exploration (or on the
    whole exploration by clicking the feedback tab in the top-right). This
    feedback will be shown in the feedback tab of the editor page for that
    exploration, and will add a notification to the "My Explorations"
    dashboards of the exploration editors.

    Rating the exploration

  <p>
    When the learner finishes playing the exploration, they are given the
    option to rate it:
