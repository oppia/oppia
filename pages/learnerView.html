	<p>The Oppia learner view is meant to simulate a chat conversation, with the difference being that the learner can respond in a lot of different ways: they can write a proof, enter a number, click on a map, and so on. </p>
	<p>The following screenshot shows the start of the "Pitch Perfect" demo exploration, where Oppia gives an introduction, and then offers the learner a music staff on which they can drag and drop notes to match the desired sequence. </p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Based on the learner's response, Oppia will give the learner hints or ask further questions, as appropriate. </p>

	 <a id="Additional_options" class="anchor" href="#Additional_options" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional options</h2>
	<p>It's also possible to do a number of other things on this page: </p>
	<h3><a id="Giving_feedback" class="anchor" href="#Giving_feedback" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Giving feedback</h3>
	<p>The learner can give feedback on any card of the exploration (or on the whole exploration by clicking the feedback tab in the top-right). This feedback will be shown in the feedback tab of the editor page for that exploration, and will add a notification to the "My Explorations" dashboards of the exploration editors. </p>

	<h3>
	 <a id="Rating_the_exploration" class="anchor" href="#Rating_the_exploration"aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rating the exploration</h3>
	<p>When the learner finishes playing the exploration, they are given the option to rate it: </p>
	<blockquote><img src="http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/exploration_rating.png" width="500">
	</blockquote>
	<p>After at least 5 ratings have been received, the average rating for the exploration will be shown in the gallery. </p>
	<h3>
	 <a id="Sharing_and_embedding" class="anchor" href="#Sharing_and_embedding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sharing and embedding</h3>
	<p>Explorations can be shared on social media via the 'Share' tab on the top right of the page. This tab also includes an option to <a href="#Embedded">embed explorations</a> in other courses or web pages. </p>
