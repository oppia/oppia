/**
 * @fileoverview Directive for the Collapsible rich-text component.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: The naming convention for customization args that are passed
 * into the directive is: the name of the parameter, followed by 'With',
 * followed by the name of the arg.
 *
 * All of the RTE components follow this pattern of updateView and ngOnChanges.
 * This is because these are also web-components (So basically, we can create
 * this component using document.createElement). CKEditor creates instances of
 * these on the fly and runs ngOnInit before we can set the @Input properties.
 * When the input properties are not set, we get errors in the console.
 * The `if` condition in update view prevents that from happening.
 * The `if` condition in the updateView and ngOnChanges might look like the
 * literal opposite but that's not the case. We know from the previous
 * statements above that the if condition in the updateView is for preventing
 * the code to run until all the values needed for successful execution are
 * present. The if condition in ngOnChanges is to optimize the re-runs of
 * updateView and only re-run when a property we care about has changed in
 * value.
