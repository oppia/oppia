"""Classes for calculations to get interaction answer views.

Calculations are performed on recorded state answers.

NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: To specify calculations desired for an interaction named
<INTERACTION_NAME>, edit

    extensions.interactions.<INTERACTION_NAME>.answer_visualizations

This is a list of visualizations, each of which is specified by a dict with keys
'id', 'options' and 'calculation_id'. An example for a single visualization and
calculation may look like this:

    answer_visualizations = [{
        'id': 'BarChart',
        'options': {
            'x_axis_label': 'Answer',
            'y_axis_label': 'Count',
        },
        'calculation_id': 'AnswerFrequencies',
    }]
