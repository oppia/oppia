      - [ ] Insert HTML
            (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213376/how-to-find-cursor-position-in-a-contenteditable-div/2213514#2213514)

      (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4122315/how-to-find-xy-position-in-javascript-with-offset/4123495#4123495)

Possible features for some version
----------------------------------

      (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2887101/apply-style-to-range-of-text-with-javascript-in-uiwebview/2888969#2888969)
- [?] More commands (block? Insert line break? Think about this, don't want to build a WYSIWYG editor)
- [ ] Add selection extend()? Don't think this is possible.
- [ ] Option in TextRange module for alternative ways to extract text for an element (see email from Bruce Augustine)
