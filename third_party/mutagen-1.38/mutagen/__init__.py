"""Mutagen aims to be an all purpose multimedia tagging library.

    import mutagen.[format]
    metadata = mutagen.[format].Open(filename)

``metadata`` acts like a dictionary of tags in the file. Tags are generally a
list of string-like values, but may have additional methods available
depending on tag or format. They may also be entirely different objects
for certain keys, again depending on format.
