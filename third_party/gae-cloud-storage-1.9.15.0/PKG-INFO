Version: 1.9.15.0
Summary: This library is the preferred way of accessing Google Cloud Storage from App Engine. It was designed to replace the Files API. As a result it contains much of the same functionality (streaming reads and writes but not the complete set of GCS APIs). It also provides key stability improvements and a better overall developer experience.
