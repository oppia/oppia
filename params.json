{"name":"Oppia","tagline":"A tool for creating interactive tutors","body":"[![Introductory video for Oppia](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Ntcw0H0hwPU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntcw0H0hwPU)\r\n\r\nOppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities. These activities, called 'explorations', simulate a one-on-one conversation with an intelligent tutor. You can try a hosted version at [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org).\r\n\r\n## Bite-size\r\nExplorations are easy to create and quick to play. They can be published in the exploration gallery, shared on social media, or embedded on your webpage.\r\n\r\n## Interactive\r\nOppia supports 'learning by doing'. Your exploration can include embedded code editors, dynamic world maps, and many other options for interaction.\r\n\r\n##Adaptive\r\nFeedback is an essential part of learning. The branching nature of Oppia allows you to respond to mistakes and address misconceptions as learners progress through an exploration.\r\n\r\nOppia runs on **free** and **open source** software. It is released under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n+ Each exploration simulates a 1-on-1 interactive conversation with a tutor.\r\n+ Targeted feedback can be given to learners based on their respective answers.\r\n+ Explorations can be embedded in any webpage.\r\n+ Analytics dashboards highlight common problems and allow explorations to be improved over time.\r\n+ Learners can leave feedback on explorations for the authors to address.\r\n+ Explorations can be easily customized using a rich online editor.\r\n+ Each exploration comes with a full version history.\r\n+ Multiple authors can collaborate on an exploration.\r\n+ Explorations are playable on mobile devices (except for some of the more complex interactions).\r\n+ Parameters can be used to create a richer, more personalized experience.\r\n+ Oppia's comprehensive extension framework allows straightforward integration of new interactions and classification rules.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n###Main page\r\n![Screenshot of main page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/images/main.png)\r\n\r\n###Gallery\r\n![Screenshot of gallery page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/images/gallery.png)\r\n\r\n###Learner view\r\n![Screenshot of learner view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/images/exploration.png)\r\n\r\n###Editor view\r\n![Screenshot of editor view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/images/explorationEditor.png)\r\n\r\n###\"My Explorations\" dashboard\r\n![Screenshot of 'my explorations' dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/images/myExplorations.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nIf you plan to download the code and run your own instance of Oppia, you need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine, together with certain other dependencies specified on our Getting Started page. If you just want to create an exploration, you can do so on the hosted community site [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org).\r\n\r\nYou can download the developers' version of Oppia using git by following the instructions on our Getting Started page. Alternatively, you can download the latest stable release as a [zip file](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nNote that Oppia also depends on various additional libraries, such as JQuery, Angular UI and Google App Engine. These libraries will be *downloaded automatically for you* when you run `scripts/start.sh`.\r\n\r\n##Contributing to Oppia\r\n\r\nOppia is built by the community for the community. Our mission is to enable anyone to learn anything they want to in an effective, enjoyable way, and building a platform that allows anyone to create and share bite-sized interactive learning material is just a first step.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which you can help out, from creating new explorations to closing open development issues. It doesn't matter if you don't have a lot of experience -- the project is very multi-faceted, and chances are we'll be able to find fun and impactful things for you to do. You might even learn something along the way!\r\n\r\nFor a more comprehensive overview of ways to help, please see the 'Contributing to Oppia' wiki page.\r\n\r\n##Helpful Links\r\n  * Getting started page (TODO: add link)\r\n  * Index to Documentation (TODO: add link)\r\n  * Join the [discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia) or subscribe to the [announcements list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-announce)\r\n  * Development Status (TODO: add link)\r\n  * [Report a bug](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n","google":"UA-66335041-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
