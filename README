INSTALLATION
************************************

Please refer to https://code.google.com/p/oppia/wiki/GettingStarted for extensive installation instructions. Here is just a short summary for developers who would like to contribute:

First, clone the Oppia repo. We suggest you make a directory called opensource/ within your home folder (mkdir opensource). Then do

     cd opensource/

and inside there, follow the instructions at the bottom of this page

    https://code.google.com/p/oppia/source/clones

to make your own copy of the Oppia repo on the code.google.com server. This means you will now have a separate repo (say oppia-yourname). You can make any changes you like to this test repo, and they will not affect the original repo (unless you try and push them to the main repo later).

Now go to the code.google.com page for your repo and git clone it to your own computer. The instructions are at

    https://code.google.com/r/[YOUR_REPO_NAME]/source/checkout

We suggest you follow the method using .netrc, since it is more convenient. After editing your ~/.netrc file, run

    git clone https://code.google.com/r/[YOUR_REPO_NAME]/

You might have to change the name of the downloaded directory to oppia,

    mv [YOUR_REPO_NAME] oppia

Then, navigate to oppia/ and install Oppia with

    bash scripts/start.sh

************************************
TESTING THE INSTALLATION
************************************
