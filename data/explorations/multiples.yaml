        of 3 or 5. These numbers are 3, 5, 6, and 9, and if we add all of them, we
        get 23. Well done!

          - Um... that does not make sense, does it? The answer for numbers less than
            10 was 23. Surely the answer for numbers less than 1000 is greater than
            that?<br>

        - Hm, that doesn't look correct. It's easy to make mistakes when adding many
          numbers together, so sometimes it might be easier to let the computer do
          it instead.<br>
