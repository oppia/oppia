              You''re close to solving this, though. There''s an easy way and a hard
              way. The easy way is to use the reasoning we''ve developed previously
              to calculate the answer with a single multiplication. The hard way is
              to systematically find all the cases, and make sure that you haven''t

              is 6, the answer for 2 balls must be 4, because you just multiply by
              2?


              If so, alas, you''ve fallen into a trap! Look carefully at the 1-ball
              case: the answer is not 1 x 2 = 2, it is just 1. So this ''multiply
              by 2'' idea is not correct. We should be careful to avoid drawing conclusions
              based on just a single case.


              Why not try again? How many ways are there to arrange two balls in a
