      value: 'Now here''s a final challenge: using what you''ve learned, can you figure
        out how many ways there are to arrange four balls in a row? Listing all the
        possibilities by hand is going to be tedious, but, by now, you''ve learned
        at least one way to calculate this number quickly and accurately.'

          - 'Yes, that is correct: the answer is 4 times the number of ways to arrange
            three balls in a row, so it is 4 times 6, which is 24! Well done.'
          - That's right! Notice how much easier this was than listing all the possibilities
            explicitly, and counting them one by one. If you can find a way to systematically
            approach the problem, you can save yourself a lot of tedious work :-)

            them.


            You''re close to solving this, though. There''s an easy way and a hard
            way. The easy way is to use the reasoning we''ve developed previously
            to calculate the answer with a single multiplication. The hard way is
            to systematically find all the cases, and make sure that you haven''t
            missed any. It''s up to you whichever you pick, but you need to get an

            If you''re working from a list of possibilities, check it to make sure
            you have no duplicates! And you might also consider using the approach
            we''ve developed earlier in the exploration -- it''s much easier, and

          Or, better yet, see if you can use a similar method to the one we've just

          - Nah, that can't be right :-) There's at least one way to arrange two balls
            in a row, isn't there?
          - That's not correct -- if you had two balls, you could put the red one
            on the left, and the blue one on the right, for instance. That's at least
            one way...

          - Yes, the question is asking for the number of permutations of 3 different
            balls, and that is 3! = 3 x 2 x 1. You can think about this by noticing
            that there are 3 ways to pick the first ball -- then, once you've done
            that, there are 2 ways to pick the second, and the last choice is forced.
            That's 3 x 2 = 6 ways.

          - Yes, the question is asking for the number of permutations of 3 different
            balls, and that is 3 factorial, or 3 x 2 x 1. You can think about this
            by noticing that there are 3 ways to pick the first ball -- then, once
            you've done that, there are 2 ways to pick the second, and the last choice
            is forced. That's 3 x 2 = 6 ways.

      default_outcome:
        dest: correct but why
        feedback:
        - 'OK! There are indeed 6 ways to arrange the balls: there are 3 ways to choose
          the leftmost one, and for each of these, there are 2 ways to choose the
          second one; the last choice is then forced. This gives 3 x 2 = 6 scenarios.


          If you do a quick search for the words ''permutation'' or ''factorial''
          on the Internet, you''ll also be able to find more information about this
          topic. See if you can figure out what the answer for 4 balls is!'
