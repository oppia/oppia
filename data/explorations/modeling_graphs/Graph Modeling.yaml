      html: Distances on a map are a very common thing to use graphs to model, as
        computers can then process these graphs to do stuff like path-finding without
        worrying about extra details that a full map would have. Note that it doesn't
        matter how far apart the vertices are when you draw them, the important thing
        is the weight of the edge.<div><br></div><div>Another piece of extra information
        we might want to add to a graph are relations that only go in one direction.
        In that case, instead of having lines between dots, we have arrows instead.
        In mathematician-speak, this would be a "directed graph", since every edge
        has a direction.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's give this a try now!</div>
