            try to form an interesting shape with it? You could try forming a triangle
            by adding just one more edge.</p>

          - <p>Creating a triangle is a nice choice! Did you know that triangles are
            the simplest closed shape that can be created in 2D? This is why they
            are also known as a simplex, or a 2-simplex in this case because it is
            two-dimensional. Let's move on.</p>
