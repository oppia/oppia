      html: "Boot verbs can also be called stem-changing verbs.<br><br>\nWhat is it\
        \ that makes it a boot verb? Well, if you use the normal way of writing out\
        \ verb conjugations, it looks like this:<br><br>\nyo                     \
        \     nosotros<br>\nt\xFA                          vosotros<br>\n\xE9l/ella/usted\
        \               ustedes<br>\n\n<br>\nAnd in a boot verb the stem changes only\
        \ in the yo, t\xFA, \xE9l/ella/usted and ustedes forms. If you draw a line\
        \ around these, it looks like a boot.<br>\n<br>\nIn the case of jugar, since\
        \ it is a verb ending in -gar, it uses the u &gt; ue stem, so what does the\
