        try every number!"<br><br>"There's gotta be a trick to make it go faster,
        though. It's way too slow if I just ask about each number one at a time. For
        example, to guess 1000 numbers, I would need 1000 tries! And the magician
        does it so much faster."<br><br>"So we need to make one guess eliminate more
        than one number. Hmm, how can we do that in the 3-number-guessing case?"<br></p>
