# This is the configuration file for the `buf generate` command.
# The below configuration tells to generate only python code for the
# proto files and put it into the proto_files directory in the root folder.
# By default, the `buf generate` command will take `buf.gen.yaml` file as the
# configuration file.

# If we want to pass this configuration file in the `buf generate` command, we
# have to use the `--template` option in the command:
#     `buf generate PROTO_FILES_PATH --template buf_gen_backend.yaml`

# To get more understanding about proto files and buf check out the wiki here:
