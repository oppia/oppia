Currently, we're working on building scalable interactive lessons called <em>explorations</em> for students in underserved populations who don't have easy access to teachers and textbooks, so that they can get tutor-like feedback on their work, as well as targeted advice on how to improve their skills. If you'd like to get in touch with us, feel free to reach out via our <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev\">oppia-dev@</a> Google Group, or contact us at <a href=\"mailto:admin@oppia.org\" class=\"inline-links\">admin@oppia.org</a>.",

    "I18N_CONTACT_PAGE_PARAGRAPH_3": "There is lots of educational research that suggests that active learning and targeted feedback lead to large learning gains, and providing support and encouraging a growth mindset helps a student feel they can succeed. Oppia is different from a lot of other platforms, in that it focuses on students learning by doing, and getting feedback when they need it. Making a good exploration is more than just uploading a video &mdash; it's important that the student can check their understanding of the concept by answering questions and getting feedback on their work.",

This involves sitting with a student and watching them complete an exploration, taking notes on what the student finds confusing, when they lose interest, when they get frustrated, or if they find an explanation unclear. It's enough to do this with 2 or 3 students for each exploration &mdash; you'll learn a lot in the process! You can then send these notes to the exploration creator, or <a href=\"#suggest\">suggest updates directly</a>, and this will help improve the exploration for other students around the world.",

    "I18N_DONATE_PAGE_FAQ_ANSWER_2": "Oppia exists to help improve equitable access to education. Many online platforms (e.g. college-level MOOC courses) favor learners who already have basic education. Those platforms also require that learners have internet connectivity, motivation to learn on their own, good knowledge of English and basic literacy etc. However, this is not true for students in underserved communities and regions, and can widen socioeconomic gaps. Oppia narrows that gap by including features specifically aimed at under-resourced communities.",
    "I18N_DONATE_PAGE_FAQ_ANSWER_3": "Since its inception, the Oppia platform has served over 1.5 million learners worldwide. Oppia has run some small-scale studies, including randomized tests, to measure the effectiveness of lessons, and these have shown positive results.
