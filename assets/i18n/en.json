At the outset, we would work together to understand how our missions align, and how Oppia can provide support. We would then work together to establish specific goals to follow through on during the partnership.<br> Since partnerships require investment on both sides, it would be helpful to have a contact who is fluent in English with whom we can communicate regularly throughout the partnership.",
