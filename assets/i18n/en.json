Also, if you'd like to teach a topic covered by an existing exploration, consider submitting feedback for the current exploration to help improve it instead &mdash; it's easier!",
    "I18N_TEACH_PAGE_PUBLICATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INSTRUCTION_2": "<strong>Teach more than a single factoid</strong> - When picking topics, try and pick either an involved, tricky concept that has nuances and depth, or a collection of related, interesting facts. It can also be nice to have a sense of progression and challenge, so that the learner gets the chance to apply a concept they've just learned to an unseen situation.",
    "I18N_TEACH_PAGE_PUBLICATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INSTRUCTION_3": "<strong>Give informative feedback</strong> - Don't just tell learners if they're correct or incorrect. Explain the reasoning, or dig deeper to try and help them understand their mistake. Use fallbacks to provide hints for open-ended questions and give learners new, useful insights.",
    "I18N_TEACH_PAGE_PUBLICATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INSTRUCTION_4": "<strong>Proofread</strong> - Ensure that your exploration is well-written and easy to read. It should be free of typos, factual errors and bugs, since these will cause it to lose credibility in the learner's eyes.",
    "I18N_TEACH_PAGE_PUBLICATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INSTRUCTION_5": "<strong>Represent it accurately</strong> - The learning objective is shown to learners who are browsing explorations, and should reflect the content of your exploration. The exploration should deliver all the content promised in the learning objective and in the exploration itself.",
    "I18N_TEACH_PAGE_PUBLICATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INSTRUCTION_6": "<strong>Stay interesting!</strong> - The best explorations tell a story, and have useful feedback. They give learners a chance to reason about concepts, try out new knowledge, and receive useful feedback on their work.",
