"""Base classes for all of Oppia's Apache Beam jobs.

Jobs are composed of the following components:
    - Pipelines
    - PTransforms
    - PValues/PCollections
    - Runners

Pipelines manage a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of PValues and the PTransforms
that compute them. Conceptually, PValues are the DAG's nodes and PTransforms are
the edges.

For example:

    .------------. io.ReadFromText(fname) .-------. FlatMap(str.split)
    | Input File | ---------------------> | Lines | -----------------.
    '------------'                        '-------'                  |
                                                                     |
       .----------------. combiners.Count.PerElement() .-------.     |
    .- | (word, count)s | <--------------------------- | Words | <---'
    |  '----------------'                              '-------'
    |
    | MapTuple(lambda word, count: '%s: %d' % (word, count)) .------------.
    '------------------------------------------------------> | "word: #"s |
                                                             '------------'
                                                                    |
                             .-------------. io.WriteToText(ofname) |
                             | Output File | <----------------------'
                             '-------------'

PCollections are PValues that represent a dataset of (virtually) any size,
including unbounded/continuous datasets. They are the primary input and output
types used by PTransforms.

Runners provide a run() method for visiting every node (PValue) in the
pipeline's DAG by executing the edges (PTransforms) to compute their values. At
Oppia, we use DataflowRunner() to have our Pipelines run on the Google Cloud
Dataflow service: https://cloud.google.com/dataflow.

        they are created. We use the registry to reject jobs with duplicate
        names and to provide the convenient: JobMetaclass.get_all_jobs().

        We use a metaclass instead of other alternatives (like decorators or a
        manual list), because metaclasses cannot be forgotten to be used,
        whereas the other alternatives can, and because they do not need help
