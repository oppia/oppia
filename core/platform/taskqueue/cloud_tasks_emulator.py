    This emulator exposes functionality that is used to provide a taskqueue API
    for both the App Engine development server and the backend unit tests.

    This emulator provides 2 types of functionality for task handling:
        1. The emulator will handle multiple priority queues containing tasks.
           One persistent thread is instantiated per priority queue and will
           constantly try to execute the next task prioritized by the
           'scheduled_for' attribute which determines when the task should be
           run.
        2. If automatic task handling is disabled, then the threads for each
           queue will not be created. Instead, the tasks will be added to the
           taskqueue by calling create_task() and tasks in an individual queue
           can be executed using process_and_flush_tasks().
