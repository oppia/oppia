# The stage of features indicates the maturity of

# 'test' or 'prod'. In general, 'dev' features are in develop and can only be
# enabled in dev environment. 'test' features are completed in development but
# still requires further testing or approvals, which can be enabled for QA
# testers. 'prod' feature has been fully tested so that it can be enabled in the
# production environment.

# be in dev stage otherwise it will cause a test error in the backend test.
