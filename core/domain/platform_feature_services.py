"""The service for gating features.

This service provides different interfaces to access the feature flag values
for clients and the backend respectively as they have different context for
evaluation of feature flag values.

For clients, please use 'evaluate_all_feature_flag_values_for_client' from
request handlers with client context.

For the backend, please directly call 'is_feature_enabled' with the name of
the feature.

For more details of the usage of these two methods, please refer their
docstrings in this file.
