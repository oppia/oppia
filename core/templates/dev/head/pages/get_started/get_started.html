        Creating an Oppia lesson is easy and free.  After you create the lesson, you share it with 
        others, and get feedback you can use to improve the lesson.  
      </p>
        
      <h3>Choose a Topic</h3>
      <p>All you need to get started is a topic you want 
        to teach.  You can create a lesson about any topic, large or small.  The ideal size of 
        topic for a lesson is one that you would cover in a single 
        class.  You can also create multiple related lessons that are intended to be completed 
        in sequence.
      </p>
        
      
      <h3>Create Your Lesson</h3>
      <p>
        When you have chosen a topic, just click ‘Create’, and log in with your Google account.    
        If you don't have a Google account, you can <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp" target="new">create one here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lesson consists of a number of steps.  A step can can include text (e.g. a written 
        explanation), pictures and video.  Each step presents the student with a question, which 
        they must attempt in order to continue. It can be a multiple choice question, or require 
        them to type something in, or any one of a number of other available interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the learner has answered the question, Oppia will give them feedback and let them 
        continue to the next step.  To see how learners experience Oppia, try out one of these lessons:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/0" target="new">Welcome to Oppia</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/N9iXI-fZTo8s" target="new">Introduction 
            to Chili Peppers</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/9" target="new">Pitch Perfect</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        More information about creating lessons can be found <a href="https://oppia.github.io/#/CreatingAnExploration" target="new">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Publish Your Lesson</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've created your lesson and you're ready for learners to see it, click the 
        'Publish' button at the top of the page.  This will make your lesson available to 
        learners around the world!
      </p>
      
      <h3>Share Your Lesson</h3>
      <p>
        After you publish the lesson, you can share it via a 
        link, or even <a href="https://oppia.github.io/#/EmbeddingAnExploration" target="new">embed 
        it in your own web page</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- todo: make it easy to get the right link to share, update this doc with that info -->
            
      <h3>Improve Your Lesson</h3>
      <p>
        When learners go through your lesson, they can send you feedback to alert you to problems
        or to share ideas for making it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, as learners use your lesson, you'll be able to see the common errors 
        they're making. Sometimes this can reveal new insights about where they are confused.  
        It's easy to augment the lesson with additional feedback if you think that other learners are 
        likely to repeat these errors. If you wanted to, you could even send the learner to a different 
        step, or "go deeper" by asking another question.
      </p>
