        Creating an exploration is easy and free. Share your knowledge with
        students around the world, and get feedback you can use to improve
        your exploration's effectiveness.
      </p>

      <h3>Choose a Topic</h3>
      <p>All you need to get started is a topic you want to teach. You can
        create an exploration about any topic, large or small. The ideal size
        of topic for an exploration is one that you would cover in a single
        class. You can also create multiple related explorations that are
        intended to be completed in sequence. This is called a <em>collection</em>.
      </p>


      <h3>Create Your Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        When you have chosen a topic, just click ‘Create’, and log in with your Google account.
        If you don't have a Google account, you can <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp" target="new">create one here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An exploration consists of multiple steps. Each step can can include text (e.g. a written
        explanation), pictures and video.  Each step presents the student with a question, which
        they must attempt in order to continue. It can be a multiple choice question, require
        them to type something in, or be any of a number of other available interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the learner has answered the question, Oppia will give them feedback and let them
        continue to the next step.  To see how learners experience Oppia, try out one of these explorations:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/0" target="new">Welcome to Oppia</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/N9iXI-fZTo8s" target="new">Introduction
            to Chili Peppers</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.oppia.org/explore/9" target="new">Pitch Perfect</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        More information about creating explorations can be found <a href="https://oppia.github.io/#/CreatingAnExploration" target="new">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Publish Your Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've created your exploration and you're ready for learners to see it, click the
        'Publish' button at the top of the page.  This will make your exploration available to
        learners around the world!
      </p>

      <h3>Share Your Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        After you publish the exploration, you can share it via a
        link, or even <a href="https://oppia.github.io/#/EmbeddingAnExploration" target="new">embed
        it in your own web page</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- todo: make it easy to get the right link to share, update this doc with that info -->

      <h3>Improve Your Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        When learners go through your exploration, they can send you feedback to alert you to problems
        or to share ideas for making it better.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, as learners use your exploration, you'll be able to see the common errors
        they're making. Sometimes this can reveal new insights about where they are confused.
        It's easy to augment the exploration with additional feedback if you think that other learners are
        likely to repeat these errors. You could even send the learner to a different
        step, or "go deeper" by asking another question.
      </p>
