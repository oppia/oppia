      <h3>We're all volunteers</h3>
      <p>
        We're a team of volunteers around the world who want to improve access
        to high-quality education. Currently, we're working on building scalable
        interactive lessons called <em>explorations</em> for students in underserved
        populations who don't have easy access to teachers and textbooks, so
        that they can get tutor-like feedback on their work, as well as targeted
        advice on how to improve their skills. If you'd like to get in touch
        with us, feel free to reach out via our
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev">oppia-dev@</a>
        Google Group, or contact us at
        <a href="mailto:admin@oppia.org" class="inline-links">admin@oppia.org</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>How Oppia is different from other learning platforms</h3>
      <p>
        There is lots of educational research that suggests that active learning
        and targeted feedback lead to large learning gains, and providing support
        and encouraging a growth mindset helps a student feel they can succeed.
        Oppia is different from a lot of other platforms, in that it focuses on
        students learning by doing, and getting feedback when they need it.
        Making a good exploration is more than just uploading a video &mdash; it's
        important that the student can check their understanding of the concept
        by doing questions and getting feedback on their work.
      </p>

      <h2>Ways you can help</h2>
      <p>
        This is a large effort, so any help you can provide is welcome! It
        doesn't matter where you come from, what language you speak, or how old
        or young you are &mdash; this is a community project, and as long as
        you're willing to help, we'd love to have you join us. Here are the main
        ways in which you can pitch in:
      </p>

      <a name="testing"></a>
      <h3>Testing existing explorations</h3>
      <p>
        Before publicizing an exploration, we want to make sure that it's
        effective and enjoyable. This means that students' skills improve by
        virtue of their playing it, and students play it to completion, even in
        the absence of any external pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that helps <strong>a lot</strong> with this is user research
        studies to see what works and what doesn't. This involves sitting with
        a student and watching them complete an exploration, taking notes on
        what the student finds confusing, when they lose interest, when they get
        frustrated, or if they find an explanation unclear. It's enough to do
        this with 2 or 3 students for each exploration &mdash; you'll learn a
        lot in the process! You can then send these notes to the exploration
        creator, or <a href="#suggest">suggest updates directly</a>, and this
        will help improve the exploration for other students around the world.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating new explorations</h3>
      <p>
        Oppia is built on the idea that great teachers can come from anywhere.
        You may be a student who loves explaining difficult concepts to your
        peers, a retiree who'd like to share their wealth of experience, a tutor,
        classroom teacher, TA or professor, or a businessperson who's looking
        for a meaningful way to spend their time. As long as the explorations
        you create are <a href="#testing">effective in helping students</a>, it
        doesn't matter what your background is.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you'd like to create free, effective lessons for students around
        the world, you've come to the right place. We encourage you to check out
        our <a href="https://oppia.github.io/#/CreatingAnExploration">creator tutorials</a>
        and <a href="/library">existing lessons</a>, and
        <a href="/get_started">start creating your own lesson</a>. In addition,
        if you'd like to ensure that your lessons have a large impact, please
        consider applying to our
        <a href="/teach">Teach with Oppia program</a>, where we will help you create,
        test, and improve your explorations for optimal impact.
      </p>

      <h3>Improving existing explorations</h3>
      <p>
        Like an existing exploration, but found something that could be better?
        You can suggest changes to any exploration directly from the exploration's
        page. Simply click the pencil icon in the upper right hand corner, and
        share what you think could be improved. The lesson's creator will receive
        your suggestions and have the opportunity to merge them into the exploration.
        This is an incredibly valuable way to contribute, especially if you can
        base your suggestions off the <a href="#testing">experiences of students</a>
        playing through the exploration.
      </p>

      <h3>Improving and maintaining the site</h3>
      <p>
        The Oppia project is fully open source, and is maintained by a large
        community of volunteers on <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/">GitHub</a>.
        We are in need of coders, designers and copywriters, so if you would
        like to help out, please drop us a line! The best way to get started is
        to follow the instructions on our
        <a href="https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki">GitHub wiki page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Donations</h3>
      <p>
        The Oppia project runs on a shoestring budget. Our main costs come from
        running the Oppia.org server, which costs several thousand dollars per
        year. We welcome donations to the project in order to cover our basic
        costs, so that we can focus on creating and distributing great
        educational content to anyone around the world who needs it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to donate to the project, please give generously at
