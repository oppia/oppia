      <p>
        Oppia's mission is to make it easy for users to learn anything they

        mission, Oppia (also "we" or "us") collects some information from its
        users to deliver an interactive and engaging experience. This Privacy
        Policy describes the types of information we collect from users of the
        Oppia website (<a href="https://www.oppia.org">https://www.oppia.org</a>)
        (the "Site") and how Oppia collects, uses, discloses, and protects that
        information. By using the Site or providing Personal Information (as
        defined below) to us, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

        Policy covers only our Site and not third-party sites or services using

        we encourage you to review the third party's privacy policy for that
        site or service.
