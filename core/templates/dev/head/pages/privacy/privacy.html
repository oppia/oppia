      <p>
        Oppia's mission is to make it easy for users to learn anything they
        want to in an effective and enjoyable way. As part of achieving that
        mission, Oppia (also "we" or "us") collects some information from its
        users to deliver an interactive and engaging experience. This Privacy
        Policy describes the types of information we collect from users of the
        Oppia website (<a href="https://www.oppia.org">https://www.oppia.org</a>)
        (the "Site") and how Oppia collects, uses, and protects that
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that the Oppia codebase (i.e., our software code, but not
        any Personal Information we have collected from our users) may be
        downloaded and hosted independently by third parties. This Privacy
        Policy covers only our Site and not third-party sites or services using
        the Oppia codebase. If you are using such a third-party site or service,
        we encourage you to review the third party's privacy policy for that
        site or service.
