          <p>
            You might know a student who's struggling with a topic at school.
            They really want to learn it, but they've gotten a bit stuck, and
            it's hard for them to get the personalized support they need. And
            it's not just this student: other students, all over the world, are
            likely to have trouble with the same topics, again and again.
          </p>

          <p>
            To address this, we're excited to announce the
            <em>Teach with Oppia</em> program, which enables anyone to
            contribute to a collection of free, accessible lessons on topics
            that learners find challenging. The lessons use Oppia's unique
            technology to recreate 1-on-1 tutoring, combining engaging
            instruction, clear explanations, and ample exercises that allow
            students to gain proficiency with the subject. Students can then do
            these lessons at their own pace, supported by useful, targeted
            feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participation in the program is free. Participants will receive
            personalized feedback on the lessons they create, as well as
            assistance with playtesting and promoting their lessons. They'll
            also be able to connect with other like-minded creators, as well as
            the Oppia development team, to ensure that their creations are as
            well-realized as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though the program runs year-round, we can only accommodate a
            certain number of participants at any given time. We accept
            submissions on a rolling basis, so please fill out
            <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ljmQ9R3AZRkT2kU23">this form</a>
            if you'd like to take part. We look forward to having you join us!

          <h2>Making Your Explorations Publishable</h2>

          <p>
            When an exploration is published, it is credited to you, and
            becomes available for anyone to learn from. In order to create a
            good learning experience for students, here's a few tips we've
            found useful:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <li>
              <strong>Teach something meaningful</strong> - Present
              information that's new to the target audience &mdash; don't just
              test knowledge they're already assumed to have. Also, if you'd
              like to teach a topic covered by an existing exploration,
              consider submitting feedback for the current exploration to help
              improve it instead &mdash; it's easier!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Teach more than a single factoid</strong> - When picking
              topics, try and pick either an involved, tricky concept that has
              nuances and depth, or a collection of related, interesting facts.
              It can also be nice to have a sense of progression and challenge,
              so that the learner gets the chance to apply a concept they've
              just learned to an unseen situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Give informative feedback</strong> - Don't just tell
              learners if they're correct or incorrect. Explain the reasoning,
              or dig deeper to try and help them understand their mistake. Use
              fallbacks to provide hints for open-ended questions and give
              learners new, useful insights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Proofread</strong> - Ensure that your exploration is
              well-written and easy to read. It should be free of typos,
              factual errors and bugs, since these will cause it to lose
              credibility in the learner's eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Represent it accurately</strong> - The learning objective
              is shown to learners who are browsing explorations, and should
              reflect the content of your exploration. The exploration should
              deliver all the content promised in the learning objective and in
              the exploration itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stay interesting!</strong> - The best explorations tell
              a story, and have useful feedback. They give learners a chance
              to reason about concepts, try out new knowledge, and receive
              useful feedback on their work.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Publication policy</h2>

          <p>
            Any owner of a private exploration can publish it at any time.
            However, low-quality explorations may be unpublished by the
            moderators, with feedback on how to improve them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Explorations are meant to be continuously improved, and
            explorations that haven't been edited for a long time may be
            considered "orphaned". In this case, ownership may be handed to the
            Oppia community at large (at moderator discretion), so that the
            exploration can continue to be improved.
