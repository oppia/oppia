        In 2012, Sean Lip was a software engineer at Google who missed the
        teaching he used to do while completing his doctorate at the University
        of Cambridge. He saw that the online education tools of the time were
        mostly recorded faces on a screen, missing the feedback and evaluation
        that teachers used to work their magic in the classroom. He dreamt of a
        tool that could not only improve the education of students around the
        world, but also improve the quality of teaching both online and off.
        That was the beginning of the Oppia project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, Oppia has grown into an educational platform with 145,000
        users and 5,500 explorations, thanks to the contributions of 110 people
        from 20 countries around the world. This entirely open source project
        is supported through The Oppia Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit
        organization directed by Sean, Amit Deutsch, and Jacob Davis. We’ve
        become a community of  coders, designers, writers, students, and teachers
        that are bonded in one common mission: help anyone learn anything. We’re
        proud that we’ve expanded while staying true to our values of community
        ownership, diversity, and student participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Oppia.org site and the learning material on it are entirely free,
        thanks to the efforts of our team of  volunteers from around the world.
        Donations to The Oppia Foundation will help us to fund server costs,
        marketing, and the distribution of learning material to students. Join
        us in bringing the joys of teaching and learning to people everywhere.
