      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        To help anyone learn anything they want to in an effective, enjoyable way.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="meet-oppia"></a>
      <h2>Meet Oppia</h2>

      <p>
        Oppia is a free, open-source learning platform. Full of interactive lessons
        called 'explorations', Oppia helps curious minds learn and teach efficiently
        and effectively.
      </p>

      <h3>Learn</h3>
      <p>
        Oppia recreates the experience of one-on-one tutoring. It adapts to your
        needs and lets you learn in the best way possible &mdash; by doing.
      </p>

      <h3>Teach</h3>
      <p>
        Oppia lets you share your knowledge with people worldwide. Anyone can create
        and contribute to an exploration. Find out more in our participation playbook.

      <h2>Participation Playbook</h2>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="community-guidelines"></a>
      <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

      <p>
        1. <strong>Once published, explorations can be updated by anyone in the Oppia community.</strong> With everyone's input, we can continuously improve explorations and make learning as perfect as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. <strong>Use good judgement when publishing explorations.</strong>
        Explorations should have significant educational value and cannot contain
        advertising, spam, vandalism and/or abuse.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. <strong>Be a good citizen.</strong> Creating multiple accounts, using
        explorations to trick users, circumventing features meant to encourage
        improvement of explorations or other such antisocial behavior will not be
        tolerated and may result in account suspension.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're unsure about an exploration topic or need clarification on
        guidelines, you can ask us on our <a href="{{SITE_FORUM_URL}}">forum</a>.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="exploration-publishing-criteria"></a>
      <h2>Exploration Publishing Criteria</h2>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-criteria"></a>
      <h3>Publication criteria</h3>
      <p>
        These publication criteria ensure explorations can be meaningfully tested,
        continually developed, and refined in a way that makes them fit to be
        featured. They're meant to be objective and precise so you can easily
        determine whether an exploration is fit for publication.
      </p>

      <p><strong><em>An exploration should:</em></strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Teach something meaningful</strong> - Present information that's
        new to the target audience. Don't just test knowledge the target audience
        is already assumed to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Teach more than a single factoid</strong> - Explorations should
        be either "deep" or "broad". "Deep" means an involved, tricky concept
        that has nuances and depth. "Broad" means a collection of related,
        interesting facts the learner can understand and better remember after
        completing the exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Give informative feedback</strong> - Don't just tell learners if
        they're correct or incorrect &mdash; explain reasoning. Tell learners
        why something is right or wrong, and how to correct it if necessary.
        Make your exploration more than just a quiz!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Avoid duplicating existing explorations</strong> - The beauty of
        Oppia is that everyone works together to make explorations maximally
        effective. If you'd like to teach an existing topic, first try submitting
        feedback for the current exploration or improving it. Only if you use a
        significantly different teaching style should you create a completely new
        exploration.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="featured-criteria"></a>
      <h3>"Featured" criteria</h3>
      <p>
        Featured explorations are educational, interesting to learners, and
        use our interactive, discovery-based learning style. For help on crafting
        useful feedback and creating explorations that fit these "Featured"
        criteria, check out our
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/wiki/DesignTips">Design Tips</a>
        wiki page!
      </p>

      <p><strong><em>A featured exploration is:</em></strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>More than memorization</strong> - The exploration does more than
        simply provide facts to memorize. It helps the user genuinely understand
        interesting concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Learning, not assessment</strong> - The exploration doesn't just
        quiz the learner. It presents and builds upon new concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Interactive</strong> - Users learn by doing. They have a chance
        to reason about concepts, try out new knowledge, and receive useful
        feedback on responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Formative feedback</strong> - The exploration's feedback gives
        learners new, useful insights. It finds a good middle ground between
        telling the learner they're wrong (or right), and giving the entire
        answer away. Also, the feedback should cover a wide range of potential
        replies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Complete and polished</strong> - Not only is the exploration
        free of typos, factual errors and bugs, it's well-written and easy to
        read. Additionally, it delivers all the content promised in the learning
        objective and in the exploration itself.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-policies"></a>
      <h2>Publication policy</h2>
      <p>
        The following policies help Oppia moderators enforce the criteria for
        publishing and featuring explorations.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publishing-an-exploration"></a>
      <h3>Publishing an Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        Any owner of a private exploration can publish it at any time. However,
        if the exploration does not fit the
        <a href="#exploration-publishing-criteria">publication criteria</a>, the site
        moderators may unpublish or delete it. (The norm is to unpublish; deletion
        is only likely in egregious cases, such as outright spam.)
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="editing-rights"></a>
      <h3>Editing rights</h3>
      <p>
        Explorations are meant to be polished and developed until they're
        "featured exploration" material. An exploration that hasn't been edited
        for a long time may be considered "orphaned". In this case, ownership
        may be handed to the community at large (at moderator discretion), so
        that Oppia community members can continue to improve it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that when you embed a particular version of your exploration in
        your site, it won't change unless the original exploration is unpublished
        or deleted. This means that even if you or other community members make
        changes to the exploration, the version embedded on your website will
        remain the same.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="releasing-an-exploration"></a>
      <h3>Releasing an exploration</h3>
      <p>
        We hope to make the exploration-release process community-driven soon,
        but here's how it works now: When an owner of an exploration &mdash; or
        anyone involved in the process &mdash; thinks the exploration is ready to
        be featured, they can post to the
        <a href="{{MODERATOR_REQUEST_FORUM_URL}}" target="_blank">Moderator Requests forum</a>.
        A moderator will play through the exploration, look at its structure,
        and decide whether it fits the "Featured" <a href="#publication-criteria">criteria</a>.
        If it does, the exploration will be marked as featured. If it doesn't, the
        moderator will work with the creator(s) to improve the exploration.
