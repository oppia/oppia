      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Oppia is a tool for creating interactive lessons called 'explorations'.
        For a quick general overview of Oppia, click
        <a href="/explore/{{ABOUT_EXPLORATION_ID}}">here</a>.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="community-guidelines"></a>
      <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>

      <p>
        1. Ownership of explorations is temporary and eventually reverts to the Oppia community. The
        idea is to make it easy for the explorations on this site to improve continuously.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Please exercise judgement before publishing an exploration. Every exploration on this site
        should have significant educational value, and should not contain advertising, spam, vandalism
        or abuse.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Creating multiple usernames, using explorations to trick users, or circumventing site
        features that are meant to encourage the improvement of explorations are examples of
        antisocial behavior that may result in account suspension.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. For contentious topics and clarifications on guidelines, please use the Oppia discussion
        forum.
      </p>

      <p>
        5. The governance model for Oppia comprises site admins and moderators. Site admins manage
        and have overall responsibility for the site; they are the final arbitrators on any dispute.
        Moderators suggest and review major edits for explorations, and enforce the behavioral norms
        described within these community guidelines.
      </p>


      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="exploration-publishing-criteria"></a>
      <h2>Exploration Publishing Criteria</h2>
      <p>
        In order to ensure that Oppia is filled with high-quality explorations that do a good job of
        helping people learn something new, there are some minimal criteria for publishing an exploration
        and, later, for moving it to the "featured" stage.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-criteria"></a>
      <h3>Publication criteria</h3>
      <p>
        The following criteria for publishing an exploration are meant to ensure that published
        explorations can be playtested meaningfully, and that it is possible to continue
        developing and refining these explorations to move towards being featured. These criteria
        are intended to be objective and precise, so that it is easy for anyone to determine whether
        a particular exploration fits the criteria.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It teaches something.</strong> The exploration should present information
        that is new to the target audience, and not just test knowledge that its target
        audience is already assumed to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It teaches more than a single factoid.</strong> The information presented
        should be either "deep" - an involved and tricky concept that has nuances and depth
        to it, or "broad" - a collection of related interesting facts that the learner can
        understand and remember better after playing through the exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It provides informative feedback.</strong> The feedback that it provides to
        the players should be more than just "Correct" or "Incorrect"; it should provide (or
        guide players toward) the reasoning about why something is right or wrong, and how
        to correct it if necessary. An exploration should be more than just a quiz!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It doesn't duplicate an existing published exploration</strong>. It's fine
        to teach the same thing using a significantly different way of teaching, but if a
        new exploration teaches the exact same things as an existing one, in the same way,
        then the effort would be better spent submitting feedback to, and improving, the
        existing one.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="featured-criteria"></a>
      <h3>"Featured" criteria</h3>
      <p>
        The criteria for featuring an exploration are meant to ensure that featured
        explorations are educational, interesting to our learners, and make appropriate
        use of the interactive, discovery-based learning style that the Oppia tool enables.
        The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/oppia/wiki/DesignTips">Design Tips</a> wiki
        page has some constructive advice on how to create explorations that fit these criteria,
        and especially on how to design useful, formative feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Understanding, not memorization.</strong> Does the exploration attempt to
        teach some interesting concept, or does it merely provide facts for the student to
        memorize?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Learning, not assessment.</strong> Does the exploration present new concepts
        to the learners, or does it simply quiz them on some set of topics? (Even if a quiz
        later gives out the right answers, this does not necessarily help a learner master
        the new concepts effectively.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Learn by doing.</strong> How is the new information presented to the learner?
        Does he have a chance to reason about the concepts himself, try out using them, and
        receive feedback on what he did?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Formative feedback.</strong> Does the feedback that you provide to the learner
        give him new useful insights into the problem? Does it find a good middle ground between
        simply telling the user he's wrong (or right), and giving the entire answer away? Do the
        feedback rules cover a wide range of possible answers and misconceptions? Is there a
        catch-all default rule that nevertheless tries to guide the learner toward a good
        solution?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Complete and polished.</strong> Is the exploration free of typos, factual errors
        and bugs? Is the text well-written and easy to read? Does the exploration deliver all
        the content it has promised to the learner, either within the exploration or as stated
        in the learning objective?
      </p>


      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publication-policies"></a>
      <h2>Publication policies</h2>
      <p>
        The following policies help Oppia moderators enforce the criteria for publishing and
        featuring explorations. All explorations hosted on {{SITE_NAME}} should ultimately be
        improved to the point where they satisfy these criteria.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="publishing-an-exploration"></a>
      <h3>Publishing an exploration</h3>
      <p>
        Any owner of a private exploration can make the decision to publish an exploration at
        any time. However, if the published exploration does not fit the
        <a href="#exploration-publishing-criteria">publication criteria</a>, the site moderators
        may unpublish or delete it, at their discretion. (The norm is to unpublish; deletion is
        only likely to happen in egregious cases, such as outright spam.)
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="editing-rights"></a>
      <h3>Editing rights</h3>
      <p>
        Explorations are meant to be polished and developed until they can be featured. An
        exploration that has not been edited for a prolonged period may be considered "orphaned",
        and ownership of it may revert to the community at large (at moderator discretion), so
        that {{SITE_NAME}} community members can continue to improve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that when you embed a particular version of your exploration in your site, this
        embedded version will not change unless the original exploration on {{SITE_NAME}} is
        unpublished or deleted. In particular, even if you or other community members make
        further additions or changes to the exploration on {{SITE_NAME}}, the version embedded
        on your website will remain the same.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="releasing-an-exploration"></a>
      <h3>Releasing an exploration</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, the process of releasing an exploration is moderator-driven, though we hope
        to make it more community-driven in the future. When an owner of the exploration - or
        anybody else involved in the process - thinks the exploration is ready to be featured,
        they can post to the
        <a href="{{MODERATOR_REQUEST_FORUM_URL}}" target="_blank">Moderator Requests forum</a>
        with a request for moderator review. A moderator will play through the exploration,
        look at its structure, and decide whether it fits the Featured
        <a href="#publication-criteria">criteria</a>. If it does, then the
        exploration will be marked as featured. If it does not, the moderator will make a series
        of specific suggestions on how to make the exploration conform to the criteria, and work
        with the creator(s) in that forum thread to get it polished and ready to be featured.
