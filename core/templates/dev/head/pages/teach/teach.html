            <h2>Teach with Oppia</h2>
            <p>
              You might know a student who's struggling with a topic at school.
              They really want to learn it, but they've gotten a bit stuck, and
              it's hard for them to get the personalized support they need. And
              it's not just this student: other students, all over the world, are
              likely to have trouble with the same topics, again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, we're excited to announce the
              <em>Teach with Oppia</em> program, which enables anyone to
              contribute to a collection of free, accessible lessons on topics
              that learners find challenging. These lessons, called
              <em>explorations</em>, use Oppia's unique technology to recreate 1-on-1
              tutoring, combining engaging instruction, clear explanations, and
              ample exercises that allow students to gain proficiency with the subject.
              Students can then do these lessons at their own pace, supported by
              useful, targeted feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, Oppia's goal is to cover as many subjects as possible.
              However, our short-term goal is to create a set of effective,
              enjoyable explorations for basic mathematics (up to pre-algebra)
              that students can use on their own, and that provably help them learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, the <em>Teach with Oppia</em> program is currently accepting
              applications from individuals who can demonstrate a passion and aptitude
              for helping students learn basic mathematics. Participants will receive
              personalized feedback on the lessons they create, as well as
              assistance with playtesting and promoting their lessons. They'll
              also be able to connect with other like-minded creators, as well as
              the Oppia development team, to ensure that their creations are as
              well-realized as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the program runs year-round, we can only accommodate a
              limited number of participants at any given time. We accept
              submissions on a rolling basis, so please fill out
              <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ljmQ9R3AZRkT2kU23">this form</a>
              if you'd like to take part.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interested individuals who wish to contribute explorations <em>not</em>
              focused on basic mathematics may also still apply. However,
              because Oppia is entirely volunteer-driven, we simply do not have
              the time to support every educator interested in the program.
              Therefore, in order to receive the same level of support from the
              Oppia team, these individuals will need to create, promote, and
              refine at least one exploration on their own first. This
              demonstrates that the individual could be a valuable long-term
              contributor to the project and is committed to Oppia's mission of
              helping anyone learn anything they want in an effective and
              enjoyable way.

              <h2>Making Your Explorations Publishable</h2>

              <p>
                When an exploration is published, it is credited to you, and
                becomes available for anyone to learn from. In order to create a
                good learning experience for students, here's a few tips we've
                found useful:
              </p>

              <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <li>
                  <strong>Teach something meaningful</strong> - Present
                  information that's new to the target audience &mdash; don't just
                  test knowledge they're already assumed to have. Also, if you'd
                  like to teach a topic covered by an existing exploration,
                  consider submitting feedback for the current exploration to help
                  improve it instead &mdash; it's easier!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Teach more than a single factoid</strong> - When picking
                  topics, try and pick either an involved, tricky concept that has
                  nuances and depth, or a collection of related, interesting facts.
                  It can also be nice to have a sense of progression and challenge,
                  so that the learner gets the chance to apply a concept they've
                  just learned to an unseen situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Give informative feedback</strong> - Don't just tell
                  learners if they're correct or incorrect. Explain the reasoning,
                  or dig deeper to try and help them understand their mistake. Use
                  fallbacks to provide hints for open-ended questions and give
                  learners new, useful insights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proofread</strong> - Ensure that your exploration is
                  well-written and easy to read. It should be free of typos,
                  factual errors and bugs, since these will cause it to lose
                  credibility in the learner's eyes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Represent it accurately</strong> - The learning objective
                  is shown to learners who are browsing explorations, and should
                  reflect the content of your exploration. The exploration should
                  deliver all the content promised in the learning objective and in
                  the exploration itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stay interesting!</strong> - The best explorations tell
                  a story, and have useful feedback. They give learners a chance
                  to reason about concepts, try out new knowledge, and receive
                  useful feedback on their work.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Publication policy</h2>

              <p>
                Any owner of a private exploration can publish it at any time.
                However, low-quality explorations may be unpublished by the
                moderators, with feedback on how to improve them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Explorations are meant to be continuously improved, and
                explorations that haven't been edited for a long time may be
                considered "orphaned". In this case, ownership may be handed to the
                Oppia community at large (at moderator discretion), so that the
                exploration can continue to be improved.
