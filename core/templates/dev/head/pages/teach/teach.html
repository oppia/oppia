            <h2>Teach with Oppia</h2>
            <p>
              You might know a student who's struggling with a topic at school.
              They really want to learn it, but they've gotten a bit stuck, and
              it's hard for them to get the personalized support they need. And
              it's not just this student: other students, all over the world, are
              likely to have trouble with the same topics, again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, we're excited to announce the
              <em>Teach with Oppia</em> program, which enables anyone to
              contribute to a collection of free, accessible lessons on topics
              that learners find challenging. These lessons, called
              <em>explorations</em>, use Oppia's unique technology to recreate 1-on-1
              tutoring, combining engaging instruction, clear explanations, and
              ample exercises that allow students to gain proficiency with the subject.
              Students can then do these lessons at their own pace, supported by
              useful, targeted feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, Oppia's goal is to cover as many subjects as possible.
              However, our short-term goal is to create a set of effective,
              enjoyable explorations for basic mathematics (up to pre-algebra)
              that students can use on their own, and that provably help them learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, the <em>Teach with Oppia</em> program is currently accepting
              applications from individuals who can demonstrate a passion and aptitude
              for helping students learn basic mathematics. Participants will receive
              personalized feedback on the lessons they create, as well as
              assistance with playtesting and promoting their lessons. They'll
              also be able to connect with other like-minded creators, as well as
              the Oppia development team, to ensure that their creations are as
              well-realized as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the program runs year-round, we can only accommodate a
              limited number of participants at any given time. We accept
              submissions on a rolling basis, so please fill out
              <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ljmQ9R3AZRkT2kU23">this form</a>
              if you'd like to take part.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interested individuals who wish to contribute explorations <em>not</em>
              focused on basic mathematics may also still apply. However,
              because Oppia is entirely volunteer-driven, we simply do not have
              the time to support every educator interested in the program.
              Therefore, in order to receive the same level of support from the
              Oppia team, these individuals will need to create, promote, and
              refine at least one exploration on their own first. This
              demonstrates that the individual could be a valuable long-term
              contributor to the project and is committed to Oppia's mission of
              helping anyone learn anything they want in an effective and
              enjoyable way.
