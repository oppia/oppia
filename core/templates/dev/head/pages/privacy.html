      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        Oppia's mission is to make it easy for anyone to learn anything they
        want to in an effective and enjoyable way. As part of achieving that
        mission, Oppia ("we" or "us") collects some information from its users
        to deliver an interactive and engaging experience. This Privacy Notice
        outlines our privacy policy for how Oppia collects, uses, and protects
        information we collect from users of the Oppia website
        (https://www.oppia.org) (the "Site"). In addition to the website, the
        Oppia codebase may be downloaded and hosted independently; this
        scenario is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="what-information-does-oppia-collect"></a>
      <h3>What information does Oppia collect?</h3>
      <p>
        Oppia is designed to be open and free, which means that you do not have
        to register or create an account to use the site content. Remember, you
        never have to share your personal information if you simply wish to
        browse public content. Please note that Oppia collects the following
        information from users of the Site:
        <ul>
          <li>
            any information collected or generated by your use of the content,
            such as:
            <ul>
              <li>your answers to Explorations</li>
              <li>when you begin and end an Exploration</li>
              <li>what pages you visit while visiting the Site</li>
              <li>
                any playthrough-specific customizations to the Exploration
                (such as randomly generated parameters)
              </li>
              <li>
                any contributions you make to the Site (such as feedback on
                Explorations, edits to Explorations, and Explorations you
                create)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            certain information about your system, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>the IP address of the computer used to access the Site</li>
              <li>what browser or device you are using to visit the Site</li>
              <li>what operating system you are using</li>
              <li>the dates and times of your visit to the Site</li>
              <li>what page you navigated to the Site from</li>
              <li>what page you navigate to when you leave the Site</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, if you do choose to register with the Site, Oppia also
        collects any information you submit to us, including the following
        sorts of personally identifiable information:
        <ul>
          <li>your email address</li>
          <li>your user name</li>
          <li>your photo (if you choose to upload one)</li>
          <li>
            any other information you submit to us during your profile
            registration process or on any forms or other input fields on the
            Site
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that data we collect about you during playthrough of an
        Exploration is tied to a randomly-generated session identifier which is
        generated on-the-fly at the start of the playthrough, and is not
        associated with any individual user identifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, since Oppia is built on
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>,
        basic per-request
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/logs/">logging</a>
        is enabled. The relevant aspects of
        <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">
          Google’s privacy policy
        </a> apply to all users of Oppia. Oppia does not use advanced logging
        capabilities beyond the default configuration.
      </p>

      <a class="oppia-about-anchor" name="how-does-oppia-use-the-information-it-collects"></a>
      <h3>How does Oppia use the information it collects?</h3>

      <p>
        Oppia uses information about Exploration playthroughs to guide the
        learning experience, to evaluate the effectiveness of contributions, to
        improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise
        improve the effectiveness of our offerings.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but,
        unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those
        publications or public disclosures will not include personally
        identifiable information.
      </p>

      <p>
        For logged-in users, Oppia uses information about exploration answers
        and completions to help users keep track of their progress, and to
        suggest new explorations for them to try. Oppia also keeps track of the
        edits, feedback and other contributions that logged-in users have made
        to site content, for attribution purposes. These records are
        world-viewable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Google App Engine, the service that Oppia runs on top of, uses cookies.
        Cookies are small text files with a string of alphanumeric characters
        that keep track of user activities. In the case of Oppia, cookies help
        us determine when users are logged in and thereby track user activity.
        If you want to modify your cookie settings, please refer to your
        browser settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oppia also uses other third party services like Google Analytics to
        better understand how our users use our website. We allow third party
        services like Google Analytics to use cookies and other technologies to
        collect this information. This information is collected directly by
        these third party services. For more information about these services,
        please refer to the privacy notice of these services.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, during your visit to our Site, you do not want information
        collected through the use of cookies, you may change the settings on
        your browser to either automatically decline cookies, or to give you
        the choice of declining or accepting the cookies from a particular site
        on a case-by-case basis, or, in some instances, to automatically delete
        cookies upon exiting the browser. If you choose not to accept cookies
        from our Site, you may experience some reduced functionality or other
        inconvenience while accessing the Site.

        necessary for us to disclose your information. Because of this, we

        authorities; (c) to enforce our Terms of Use; (d) to protect our, your,
