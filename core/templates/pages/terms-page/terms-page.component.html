    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      Oppia is a learning platform that allows Users to participate in an
      interactive learning experience by uploading and editing a wide variety of
      content, such as Explorations, Collections, and Derivatives (collectively,

      through Explorations (or Collections of Explorations) to learn about
      topics that they're interested in, create their own Explorations, create
      Derivatives of existing Explorations, or provide edits to any of the
      Educational Content. To participate in our community, Users can register
      and create personalized Profiles that include information about themselves
      and the Educational Content to which they've contributed. We do not charge
      Users for any of our services.

    <h2>Hosted Created Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All our Educational Content is meant to be shared, refined, and &mdash;
      obviously &mdash; explored! You can further this goal by uploading or
      creating your own Educational Content on the Website or by editing or
      contributing to an Exploration that is already published on the Website.
      If you upload or submit any Educational Content or any other content or
      materials to the Website or your User Profile (collectively,
      "<strong>Submissions</strong>"), we will need certain rights from you to

      multiple tiers), royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license,
      without compensation to you, to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt
      (including to edit, modify, translate, and reformat, and to allow third
      parties to do the same), create derivative works of, transmit, publicly
      display and publicly perform such Submissions, in any media now known or
      hereafter developed. Please note that, because this license is
      non-exclusive, you retain ownership of your Submissions and may license
      them to others.

    <h2 class="oppia-h2-text">Refraining from Certain Activities</h2>

    <p>
      Oppia is an extremely collaborative environment that allows users to
      create content and learn from each other. Please remember that you are
      legally responsible for all your Submissions to the Website. Therefore, we
      encourage our users to be courteous towards each other, and follow the
      Golden Rule: "Treat others the way that you wish to be treated."
    </p>

    <p>
      To protect this collaborative environment, we forbid certain sets of
      behavior on this site, specifically:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Harassing and abusing others:</strong> engaging in harassing,
        threatening, stalking, spamming, vandalism.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Infringing on the privacy of others:</strong> this can include
        soliciting Personal and Private Identifiable Information of others,
        infringing upon the privacy of others (whether it be under American laws
        or laws under the User's jurisdiction), or collecting Personal
        Identifiable Information from minors (i.e. those under 18).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Engaging in fraud, or impersonating someone else, or spreading
        libel.</strong>

        <strong>Engaging in disruptive activities:</strong> examples include
        distributing viruses, adware, spyware, worms, "Trojan horses", or other
        malicious code on our platform that could potentially harm our technical
        infrastructure, placing an undue burden on our servers (e.g. DDoS
        attack), automated uses ("macros", "bots", etc.) of the site that hasn't
        been approved by the Oppia admins, or disrupting Oppia's services in any
        way.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <a class="oppia-privacy-terms-anchor" #termination></a>
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      If you violate any of the Terms of Use above, break any laws, engage in
      behavior that disrupts the Oppia community, or otherwise engage in any
      prohibited behavior, then we may, in our sole discretion, terminate your
      account. You agree that if your account is so terminated, Oppia will not
