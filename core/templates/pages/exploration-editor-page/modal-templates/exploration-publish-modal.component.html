      Congratulations, you're about to publish an exploration!
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      Before publishing, please ensure that your exploration fits the
      <span><a href="/creator-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site publication criteria</a></span>. In particular, it should:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>help its intended audience learn something new</li>
      <li>provide useful feedback/guidance to help them if they get stuck.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
      Once the exploration is published, it will be available in the Oppia library for anyone to learn from and provide feedback. You can also check out
        its stats by clicking on the Stats tab in the top right of the editor.
