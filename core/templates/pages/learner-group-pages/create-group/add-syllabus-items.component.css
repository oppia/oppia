/*
  NOTE to developers: Only the files ending with '.css' (but not '.rtl.css') should be edited. The styling should
  be generalized enough that the autogenerated '.rtl.css' files should work
  without any manual input.
  The '.rtl.css' file can be generated by running the
  'python -m scripts.rtl_css --mode generate' script.
  Some additional rules that can be added to the CSS files can be found here:
  https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives .
