      NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: The d attribute defines a path to be drawn. The definition uses commands
      (letters) and parameters (numbers) to represent motions.
      For more details, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d.

      The following commands are used to draw the completion bar:
          `M` command: Move the current point to the coordinate x, y.
              x: number (in pixels).
              y: number (in pixels).
          `a` command: Draws an arc curve from the current point to a point for which coordinates
                       are those of the current point shifted by dx along the x-axis and dy along
                       the y-axis. The center of the ellipse used to draw the arc is determined
                       automatically based on the other parameters of the command:
              rx: number. Horizontal radius of the ellipse in pixels.
              ry: number. Vertical radius of the ellipse in pixels.
              angle: number. Rotation of the ellipse relative to the x-axis in degrees.
              large-arc-flag: boolean. When 1, follows the larger of two arcs which would connect
                              the two end-points of the arc, otherwise the smaller of the two.
              sweep-flag: boolean. When 1, follows the path of the arc using a clockwise motion,
                          otherwise with an anti-clockwise motion.
              dx: number. Shift in x coordinate from the beginning point to the end point in pixels.
              dy: number. Shift in y coordinate from the beginning point to the end point in pixels.
