Hi all,

The main changes in this release are [Add main changes].

Please welcome Alice for whom this release marks their first contribution to Oppia!

Thanks to Bob and Paul, our returning contributors who made this release possible.

Finally, I'd like to thank [Add names of release testers] for their help with pre-release testing, bug-fixing and QA, as well as Tom for leading the QA team for this release.

Thanks,
Ruth
