# This is the official list of people who can contribute (and typically
# have contributed) code to the Oppia repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people. For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
#     https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual
#     https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate
#
# When adding Joe Contributor's name to this file, either Joe's name
# or Joe's organization's name should be added to the AUTHORS file,
# depending on whether the individual or corporate CLA was used.
#
# Names should be added to this file as:
#     Name <email address>
#
# Please keep the list sorted alphabetically.
