This folder holds the test-modules-mappings of each test type; right now it only contains the mappings for acceptance tests. These mappings are used to determine which tests to run in the Github CI. These files should not be manually altered with your own Angular modules; instead if the CI asks you to update these files, either run the test locally and they will automatically generate, or copy and paste the modules that the CI gives into the needed destination. For more information refer to the wiki page here: https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Partial-CI-Tests-Structure.
