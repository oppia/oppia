The root-files-config.json holds the root files that are valid, there are two places a root file can go, the RUN_NO_TESTS_ROOT_FILES and RUN_ALL_TESTS_ROOT_FILES. If the CI gives you an error regarding this config file, please add the root file to one of these lists, depending on if it needs to run tests or not.
