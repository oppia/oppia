To decide which CI tests need to be run on a PR, we need to know how files depend on each other. These dependencies can be described as a set of dependency trees where the files depend on their parents and are dependencies of their children. The root of each tree is therefore a file that no other file depend upon. These root files are stored in root-files-config.json under one of two keys: RUN_NO_TESTS_ROOT_FILES for files that don't affect any functionality and RUN_ALL_TESTS_ROOT_FILES for files that could change Oppia's behavior. If the CI gives you an error regarding this config file, please add the root file to one of these lists, depending on if it needs to run tests or not. For more information, refer to the wiki here: https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Partial-CI-Tests-Structure#root-files-config.
