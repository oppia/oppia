This folder holds the files that are needed mainly when running the scripts.check_ci_test_suites_to_run. The files root-files-mapping-generator.ts and typescript-ast-utilities.ts are used to find which root modules and files are linked together. The test-to-modules-matcher.ts and route-to-module-mapping-generator.ts are used by acceptance tests to find out which modules are affected by a certain test. For more information refer to the wiki page here: https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Partial-CI-Tests-Structure.
