# exclude_lines is used to exclude a particular clause.
# Any line with a comment of “pragma: no cover” is excluded.
# If that line introduces a clause, for example, an if clause, function or class,
# then the entire clause is also excluded. Similarly, @overload is used to exclude 
# a particular function's multiple signatures, which are skipped during runtime.
