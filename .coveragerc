# The 'exclude_lines' is used to skip a particular clause in coverage.
# We exclude any line with a comment of “pragma: no cover” as this is the default option
# provided by the coverage library.
# We also exclude @overload, because it is used for defining multiple MyPy definitions 
# of a function and cannot be tested by Python tests.
