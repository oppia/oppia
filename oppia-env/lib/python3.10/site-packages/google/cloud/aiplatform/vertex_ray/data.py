    The data to read from is specified via the ``project_id``, ``dataset``

    Args:
        project_id: The name of the associated Google Cloud Project that hosts
            the dataset to read.
        dataset: The name of the dataset hosted in BigQuery in the format of
            ``dataset_id.table_id``. Both the dataset_id and table_id must exist
            otherwise an exception will be raised.
        query: The query to execute. The dataset is created from the results of
            executing the query if provided. Otherwise, the entire dataset is read.
            For query syntax guidelines, see
            https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax
        parallelism: 2.33.0, 2.42.0: This argument is deprecated. Use
            ``override_num_blocks`` argument. 2.9.3: The requested parallelism of
            the read. If -1, it will be automatically chosen based on the available
            cluster resources and estimated in-memory data size.
        ray_remote_args: kwargs passed to ray.remote in the read tasks.
        concurrency: Supported for 2.33.0 and 2.42.0 only: The maximum number of
            Ray tasks to run concurrently. Set this to control number of tasks to
            run concurrently. This doesn't change the total number of tasks run or
            the total number of output blocks. By default, concurrency is
            dynamically decided based on the available resources.
        override_num_blocks: Supported for 2.33.0 and 2.42.0 only: Override the
            number of output blocks from all read tasks. By default, the number of
            output blocks is dynamically decided based on input data size and
            available resources. You shouldn't manually set this value in most
            cases.

        Dataset producing rows from the results of executing the query
        or reading the entire dataset on the specified BigQuery dataset.
