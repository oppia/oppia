            name (:class:`str`):
                Required. Full resource name of the format:
                ``{name=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store/placements/*}``
                The id of the recommendation engine placement. This id
                is used to identify the set of models that will be used
                to make the prediction.

                We currently support three placements with the following
                IDs by default:

                -  ``shopping_cart``: Predicts items frequently bought
                   together with one or more catalog items in the same
                   shopping session. Commonly displayed after
                   ``add-to-cart`` events, on product detail pages, or
                   on the shopping cart page.

                -  ``home_page``: Predicts the next product that a user
                   will most likely engage with or purchase based on the
                   shopping or viewing history of the specified
                   ``userId`` or ``visitorId``. For example -
                   Recommendations for you.

                -  ``product_detail``: Predicts the next product that a
                   user will most likely engage with or purchase. The
                   prediction is based on the shopping or viewing
                   history of the specified ``userId`` or ``visitorId``
                   and its relevance to a specified ``CatalogItem``.
                   Typically used on product detail pages. For example -
                   More items like this.

                -  ``recently_viewed_default``: Returns up to 75 items
                   recently viewed by the specified ``userId`` or
                   ``visitorId``, most recent ones first. Returns
                   nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet.
                   For example - Recently viewed.

                https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/datafeeds/default_catalog/dashboard

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            user_event (:class:`google.cloud.recommendationengine_v1beta1.types.UserEvent`):
                Required. Context about the user,
                what they are looking at and what action
                they took to trigger the predict
                request. Note that this user event
                detail won't be ingested to userEvent
                logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write
                request is required for event logging.

                This corresponds to the ``user_event`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.recommendationengine_v1beta1.services.prediction_service.pagers.PredictAsyncPager:
                Response message for predict method.
