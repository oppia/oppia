        Creates a new read session. A read session divides

        table. The read session also specifies properties of the

        push-down filter describing the rows to be returned.

        A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When
        the caller has reached the end of each stream in the
        session, then all the data in the table has been read.

        Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the
        same number of rows can be read from each stream.
        Because the server-side unit for assigning data is
        collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that
        each stream will return the same number or rows.
        Additionally, the limits are enforced based on the
        number of pre-filtered rows, so some filters can lead to
        lopsided assignments.
