_Thanks for taking the time to report a bug in the Oppia project, or propose a new feature! Before filing a new issue, please do a quick search to check that it hasn't already been filed on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues)._

If you'd like to report a bug, please include the following information:
- the expected behaviour
- the observed behaviour
- steps to reproduce the problem
- which operating system and/or browser you're using, if relevant
- (if possible) copies of the console/server logs

On the other hand, if you'd like to propose a new feature:
- please describe, as clearly as possible, what you'd like to see
- (if possible) include mockups/screenshots, if these would help convey the meaning better

Thanks!
