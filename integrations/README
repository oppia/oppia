Third-party integrations
------------------------

The subdirectories of this folder contain files that can be used to embed Oppia
explorations in other platforms, or in any webpage. More information on
integration can be found in the README file at the root of each subdirectory.

Currently-supported integrations include:

    (a) Oppia in any web page: see the directory

            integrations/oppia_player_[DATE]_v[VERSION]

    (b) Oppia in Course Builder: see the directory

            integrations/gcb_oppia_tag_[DATE]_v[VERSION]

(Here, DATE is the date when the version was released in the form YYYY_MM_DD,
and VERSION is a version string in the form 0.0.0)
