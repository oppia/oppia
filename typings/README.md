##  Adding type-defs for third party libraries present in third-party-defs.d.ts


### Find the source code of the third party library

For adding type definitions for a js library, the first step is to find the source code of the library.

Try to find the file that imports the js script of the library. For example **PencilCodeEmbed** is imported by the [pencilcode.html](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/extensions/interactions/pencilcode.html) file.

### Create a file for the type definitions

Create a file which will contain the type definitions in the typings directory with name `library-name-defs.d.ts`.


### Write the type definitions

For writing custom definitions, existing type definitions in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) and [this guide](http://blog.wolksoftware.com/contributing-to-definitelytyped) can be used as a reference.

 
### Testing the definitions

The type checks run with the typescript tests. So you can run the following command to see if the definitions you wrote are correct:

```bash

python -m scripts.typescript_checks

```


### Updating the version of the library

- Look for the difference in the code of the library compared to the present version.

- Update the type definitions accordingly if the arguments or return types are modified or some new functions or variables are defined.
