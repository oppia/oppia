You can extend Course Builder with additional functionality by adding modules
to it. Here are the instructions for adding an oppia_tag module to Course
Builder:

1. Download Course Builder v1.7.0.

2. In your installation of Course Builder, navigate to coursebuilder/modules
and create an oppia_tag directory.

3. Copy the files in

    /integrations/gcb_oppia_tag_{{DATE}}_v{{VERSION}}/coursebuilder/modules/oppia_tag

into this directory.

4. Modify Course Builder's app.yaml file to include the following entry in
env_variables > GCB_REGISTERED_MODULES:

    modules.oppia_tag.oppia_tag

5. Start Course Builder. In the course editor interface, click on a toolbox in
the rich-text editor to add a component. 'Oppia exploration' should be among
the options presented for this component. In the associated dialog box, you can
enter the exploration id and the server on which the exploration is hosted.
