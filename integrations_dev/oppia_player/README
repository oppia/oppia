Embedding Oppia explorations in any web page            Version {{VERSION}}
--------------------------------------------

Download the contents of the

    /integrations/oppia_player_{{DATE}}_v{{VERSION}}/

directory to a server, and insert the following HTML tag at the bottom of your
web page:

    <script src="PATH_TO_OPPIA_PLAYER_DIRECTORY/oppia-player-{{VERSION}}.js">
    </script>

Then, you can include tags of the form

    <oppia oppia-id="fjJDek214F2g" exploration-version="3" src="https://www.oppia.org">
    </oppia>

in your webpage, and these will then be converted into iframes that embed
playable Oppia explorations. The script also provides event hooks which you
can overwrite in the page containing it.
