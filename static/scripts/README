TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

This folder contains embedding scripts for Oppia explorations, and tests for
them. Currently, the tests need to be done manually. They should be run as
follows:

- Load the 'Welcome' demo exploration (with id '0') on a local development
  server.
- Change the content of the initial state to anything you like. This changes
  the exploration to version 2.
- In a browser window, open each of the HTML files in this folder, and ensure
  that they do the correct thing. Use URLs of the following form:

      http://localhost:8181/scripts/embedding_tests_dev_0.0.1.html


The features supported in each version of the embedding script are as follows:

- v0.0.0: simple embedding; embedding a particular version of an exploration;
    embedding with event hooks.
- v0.0.1: simple embedding; embedding a particular version of an exploration;
    embedding with event hooks; embedding with delayed loading and a 'load'
    button.


TODO(sll): Write automated end-to-end tests that load the HTML pages and check
that the relevant embedding assertions are satisfied.
