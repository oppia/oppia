"""Script to compile a deterministic 'requirements.txt' file.

This needs to be a separate script because the python function that regenerates
the requirements file is a command-line interface (CLI) script. Once the CLI
finishes execution, it forces itself and any python scripts in the current
callstack to exit.
Therefore, in order to allow continued execution after the requirements
file is generated, we must call the CLI in a separate process.
