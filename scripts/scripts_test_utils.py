class PopenStub(python_utils.OBJECT):
    """Stubs the API of psutil.Popen() to make unit tests less expensive.

    Starting a new process for every unit test is intrinsically more expensive
    than checking an object's attributes, and for some developers it isn't even
    possible for them to kill a spawned process due to a lack of permission on
    their operating system.

    We used to spawn real processes for tests, and observed the following:
        With actual processes: Runs 78 tests in 50.7 seconds
        With PopenStub:        Runs 97 tests in 32.3 seconds

    Thus, using this stub gives us a ~4.62x speed boost per-test.

    Attributes:
        pid: int. The ID of the process.
        stdout: str. The text written to standard output by the process.
        stderr: str. The text written to error output by the process.
        poll_count: int. The number of times poll() has been called.
        signals_received: list(int). List of received signals (as ints) in order
            of receipt.
        terminate_count: int. Number of times terminate() has been called.
        kill_count: int. Number of times kill() has been called.
        alive: bool. Whether the process should be considered to be alive.
        reject_signal: bool. Whether to raise OSError in send_signal().
        reject_terminate: bool. Whether to raise OSError in terminate().
        reject_kill: bool. Whether to raise OSError in kill().
        unresponsive: bool. Whether the process will end normally.
        returncode: int. The return code of the process.
