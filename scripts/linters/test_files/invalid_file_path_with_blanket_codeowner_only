# We will list a new file in /core/domain, so that it becomes a file that is covered by blanket codeowners only.

# Blanket codeowners
# This is for the case when new files are created in any directories that aren't
# covered as a whole, since in these cases, codeowners are not recognized for
# those files when reviewing, even if the PR does add it. Unless new
# files/folders are created in the following directories, these codeowners would
# be superseded by the relevant codeowners mentioned elsewhere in this file.
# (Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners)
