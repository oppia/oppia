#   --sharding=true/false Disables/Enables parallelization of protractor tests.
#   --sharding-instances=# Sets the number of parallel browsers to open while sharding.
# Sharding must be disabled (either by passing in false to --sharding or 1 to
# --sharding-instances) if running any tests in isolation (iit or ddescribe).

# The root folder MUST be named 'oppia'.
