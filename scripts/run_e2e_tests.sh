# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# Run this script from the oppia root folder:
#   bash scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh
#
# Optional arguments:
#   --skip-install=true/false If true, skips installing dependencies. The
#         default value is false.
#   --sharding=true/false Disables/Enables parallelization of protractor tests.
#   --sharding-instances=# Sets the number of parallel browsers to open while
#         sharding.
#   --prod_env Run the tests in prod mode. Static resources are served from
#         build directory and use cache slugs.
# Sharding must be disabled (either by passing in false to --sharding or 1 to
# --sharding-instances) if running any tests in isolation (iit or ddescribe).
#   --suite=suite_name Performs test for different suites.
#   For performing a full test, no argument is required.
#   For performing tests on editors, use --suite=editor
#   For performing tests on extensions, use --suite=extensions
#   For performing tests on library, use --suite=library
#   For performing miscellaneous tests, use --suite=misc
#
# The root folder MUST be named 'oppia'.
