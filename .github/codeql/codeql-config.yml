  # TODO(#16763): The use of SHA-1 in this file causes CodeQL to throw the error
  # "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data."
  # The results of the function using SHA-1 are stored in some places, but the
  # function is not used for enciphering and preimage attacks are not a big risk
  # for SHA-1. We can migrate to a stronger cryptographic algorithm, replacing
  # all SHA-1, but that would require changes to the existing data we have.

  # error to be thrown by CodeQL (cases enumerated in the issue). If we define a
  # central method for this stripping, we can remove these files.
