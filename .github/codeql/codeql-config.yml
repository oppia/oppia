  # TODO: This file causes CodeQL to throw the error "Use of a broken or weak
  # cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data," (line 568), but the
  # results of the function are stored in some places, and SHA-1 is not used for
  # enciphering so preimage attacks are not a risk. We can migrate to a stronger
  # cryptographic algorithm, replacing all SHA-1.
