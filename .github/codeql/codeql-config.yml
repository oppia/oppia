  # TODO(#16763): The use of SHA-1 in this file causes CodeQL to throw the error
  # "Use of a broken or weak cryptographic hashing algorithm on sensitive data,"
  # but the results of the function are stored in some places, and SHA-1 is not
  # used for enciphering so preimage attacks are not a risk. We can migrate to a
  # stronger cryptographic algorithm, replacing all SHA-1.
