## PR Pointers

- Make sure to follow the [instructions for making a code change](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#instructions-for-making-a-code-change).
- Oppiabot will notify you when you don't add a PR_CHANGELOG label. If you are unable to do so, please @-mention a code owner (who will be in the Reviewers list), or ask on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat).
- For what code owners will expect, see the [Code Owner's wiki page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Oppia%27s-code-owners-and-checks-to-be-carried-out-by-developers).
- Make sure your PR follows conventions in the [style guide](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Coding-style-guide), otherwise this will lead to review delays.
- Never force push. If you do, your PR will be closed.
- Oppiabot can assign anyone for review/help if you leave a comment like the following: "{{Question/comment}} @{{reviewer_username}} PTAL"
- Some of the e2e tests are flaky, and can fail for reasons unrelated to your PR. We are working on fixing this, but in the meantime, if you need to restart the tests, please check the ["If your build fails" wiki page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/If-your-build-fails).
