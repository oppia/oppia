## Proof that changes are correct

<!--
Add before-and-after videos/screenshots of the user-facing interface (including
the browser devtools console) to demonstrate that the changes made in this PR
work correctly. Make sure the actions taken in the before and after videos are
the same. (For changes involving responsiveness or adjustment of UI elements,
this should be a video that gradually resizes the viewport from wide to narrow
and back again.) If this PR is for a developer-facing feature, provide
videos/screenshots of the developer-facing interface instead.

When you make updates to the PR, please update these videos/screenshots as well.
You can drop videos/screenshots from previous versions of the PR.

The above should be done for all PRs, including short ones (e.g. a single-line change).
However, if the changes in your PRs are autogenerated via a script and you cannot
provide proof for the changes then please leave a comment "No proof of changes
needed because {{Reason}}" and remove all the sections below.

#### Proof of changes on desktop with slow/throttled network

<!--
Make sure to properly verify that everything works correctly, and that there are
no weird UI mistakes or other problems. Also, if there are any newly added fields,
try to fill them out and test that different inputs are correctly accepted/rejected.

Throttle the network (to 3G) using the browser Developer Tools (see references below).
There should be no performance or UI issues while the network is slow.

#### Proof of changes on mobile phone

<!--
In some cases this is not needed (e.g. for pages that we do not expect to
support mobile phones, or for backend-only features).

Feel free to use the Developer Tools emulator for this.

#### Proof of changes in Arabic language

<!--
If the PR changes the UI, make sure to add screenshots with the site
language set to Arabic as well (we use Arabic as it is a language written from right to left).
