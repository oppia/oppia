#### Proof of changes on desktop with slow/throttled network

<!--
Make sure to properly verify that everything works correctly, and that there are
no weird UI mistakes or other problems. Also, if there are any newly added fields,
try to fill them out and test that different inputs are correctly accepted/rejected.

Throttle the network (to 3G) using the browser Developer Tools (see references below).
There should be no performance or UI issues while the network is slow.

#### Proof of changes on mobile phone

<!--
In some cases this is not needed (e.g. for pages that we do not expect to
support mobile phones, or for backend-only features).

Feel free to use the Developer Tools emulator for this.
