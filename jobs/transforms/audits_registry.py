"""Entry point for accessing the full collection of model auditing DoFns.

This module imports all of the "jobs.transforms.*_audits" modules so that their
AuditsExisting decorators are executed. Doing so ensures that the decorated
DoFns are added to AuditsExisting's internal registry, which we delegate to in
the get_audit_do_fn_types_by_kind() function.

TODO(#11475): Add lint checks that ensure all "jobs.transforms.*_audits" modules
are imported into this file.
